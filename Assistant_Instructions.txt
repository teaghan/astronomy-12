### The Ancient Roots of Astronomy

> **Did You Know?**
> The ancient Babylonians were among the first to create detailed records of celestial events, which helped them develop a calendar and predict lunar eclipses.

Our story begins in ancient Babylon and Egypt, where early astronomers meticulously observed the skies. These civilizations recorded the movements of celestial bodies, using their observations to predict events like eclipses and the flooding of the Nile. The Babylonians developed star catalogs, while the Egyptians created a 365-day calendar based on the heliacal rising of Sirius.

| Civilization | Key Contributions                                         |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Babylon      | Star catalogs, lunar eclipse predictions                  |
| Egypt        | 365-day calendar based on Sirius                          |
| Greece       | Mathematical harmony, spherical Earth, Ptolemaic model    |
| Mayans       | Accurate calendars, predictions of solar and lunar cycles |
| Chinese      | Earliest recorded supernova, detailed star maps           |

As we move forward in time, we encounter the Greeks, who made significant contributions to our understanding of the cosmos. Pythagoras proposed a mathematical harmony in nature, influencing later cosmologies. Aristotle argued for a spherical Earth, based on the shape of Earth's shadow during lunar eclipses.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teaghan/astronomy-12/main/Unit1/figures/Aristotle.png" alt="Aristotle Image" width="1000" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

Eratosthenes, a brilliant mathematician, measured Earth's circumference with remarkable accuracy using the angles of shadows in different locations.

In Alexandria, Claudius Ptolemy developed the geocentric model, which placed Earth at the center of the universe, with planets and stars orbiting it in complex patterns of circles within circles. This model dominated astronomical thought for over a thousand years.

<img src="https://github.com/teaghan/astronomy-12/blob/main/Unit1/figures/Ptolemy.png?raw=true" alt="Ptolemy Image" width="1000" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

### The Copernican Revolution

The scene shifts to Renaissance Europe, where a quiet revolution was brewing. Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish astronomer, proposed a heliocentric model that placed the Sun at the center of the universe. This radical idea challenged the long-held geocentric model and set the stage for a seismic shift in our understanding of the cosmos.

> **Interesting Side Note**:
> Copernicus hesitated to publish his work due to fear of criticism and persecution. His groundbreaking book, "De revolutionibus orbium coelestium," was published just before his death in 1543.

<img src="https://github.com/teaghan/astronomy-12/blob/main/Unit1/figures/Copernicus.png?raw=true" alt="Copernicus Image" width="1000" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

Enter Galileo Galilei, the Italian polymath who used a telescope to observe the heavens like never before. Galileo discovered moons orbiting Jupiter and phases of Venus, providing concrete evidence for the heliocentric model. His findings sparked a clash with the Catholic Church, illustrating the tension between science and established beliefs.

<img src="https://github.com/teaghan/astronomy-12/blob/main/Unit1/figures/Galileo.png?raw=true" alt="Galileo Image" width="1000" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

Johannes Kepler, a contemporary of Galileo, formulated three laws of planetary motion, describing the orbits of planets as ellipses rather than circles. Kepler's laws revolutionized our understanding of planetary motion and paved the way for further discoveries.

<img src="https://github.com/teaghan/astronomy-12/blob/main/Unit1/figures/Kepler.png?raw=true" alt="Kepler Image" width="1000" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

Isaac Newton, the English mathematician and physicist, provided the theoretical foundation for Kepler's laws with his laws of motion and universal gravitation. Newton's work unified the physical description of the universe and laid the groundwork for classical mechanics.

### The Birth of Modern Astronomy

Our journey continues into the 18th century with William Herschel, who discovered Uranus and used large telescopes to catalog thousands of stars and nebulae. Herschel's work expanded our understanding of the cosmos and revealed the vastness of the universe.

The development of spectroscopy in the 19th century marked a new era in astronomy. Joseph Fraunhofer discovered dark lines in the solar spectrum, leading to the identification of chemical elements in stars. Gustav Kirchhoff and Robert Bunsen further advanced this field, allowing astronomers to determine the composition of stars and other celestial bodies.

# 1.2 The Scale of the Universe

## Introduction

In the winter of 1995, scientists pointed the Hubble Space Telescope at a seemingly empty patch of sky near the Big Dipper. Over ten consecutive days, the telescope took close to 150 hours of exposure of this dark, unobtrusive spot. What came back was nothing short of spectacular: an image of over 1,500 distinct galaxies glimmering in a tiny sliver of the universe. This was just a fraction of the sky, about the size of a ballpoint pen tip held at arm's length, revealing an incredible truth about the vastness of our cosmos. This lesson will explore the immense scales of the universe, from our solar system to the farthest reaches observed by humanity, illustrating the vast distances and sizes that define our universe.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-success">
  <h4>Video</h4>
  <p>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYQ3O8U6SMY" target="_blank">this video</a> for a discussion on the scale of the universe. It includes the distances and sizes of celestial objects and provides a visual representation of the concepts covered in this lesson.</p>
</div>

---

## Scientific Notation

To understand the vast distances and sizes in the universe, we need to use scientific notation. This method allows us to express very large and very small numbers in a manageable way. For example, the distance from the Earth to the Sun is about 150,000,000 kilometers, which can be written as $1.5 \times 10^8$ kilometers.

> Scientific notation helps simplify calculations and comparisons of astronomical figures.

---

## The Size and Scale of the Solar System

The solar system is our cosmic neighborhood, and its scale is immense. The Sun, the central star, has a diameter of about 1.4 million kilometers. Earth, the third planet from the Sun, has a diameter of about 12,700 kilometers. The average distance from Earth to the Sun is approximately 150 million kilometers, also known as 1 Astronomical Unit (AU).

Imagine if the Sun were the size of a basketball. In this model, Earth would be a small apple seed 30 meters away.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teaghan/astronomy-12/main/Unit1/figures/Our_Solar_Family.png" alt="Our Solar Family" width="1000" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

---

## Interstellar Distances

Beyond our solar system, the distances between objects become even more staggering. A light-year, the distance light travels in one year, is about 9.46 trillion kilometers. The nearest star to the Sun, Proxima Centauri, is approximately 4.24 light-years away.


> **Derivation of a Light Year**:
> Light travels at a speed of approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (km/s) in a vacuum.
> There are 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 24 hours in a day.
>
> $$ \text{Speed of light} = 299,792 \, \text{km/s} $$
>
> $$ \text{Seconds in a minute} = 60 $$
>
> $$ \text{Minutes in an hour} = 60 $$
>
> $$ \text{Hours in a day} = 24 $$
>
> $$ \text{Days in a year} = 365.25 $$
>
> To find the distance light travels in one year:
>
> $$ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} $$
>
> First, calculate the number of seconds in a year:
>
> $$ 60 \times 60 \times 24 \times 365.25 \approx 31,557,600 \, \text{seconds/year} $$
>
> Then, multiply the speed of light by the number of seconds in a year:
>
> $$ 299,792 \, \text{km/s} \times 31,557,600 \, \text{s/year} \approx 9.46 \times 10^{12} \, \text{kilometers/year} $$
>
> Therefore, one light-year is approximately 9.46 trillion kilometers.


### Parallax: Measuring Stellar Distances

Parallax is a method used to measure the distances to nearby stars by observing their apparent movement against the background of more distant stars as Earth orbits the Sun. The parallax angle is half the angle that a star appears to move over six months.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teaghan/astronomy-12/main/Unit1/figures/Parallax.png" alt="Parallax" width="1000" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

#### Development of Parallax

The concept of parallax dates back to ancient Greece, where Hipparchus, a Greek astronomer, used it to estimate the distance to the Moon around 150 BCE. Hipparchus observed the apparent shift in the position of the Moon against the background stars when viewed from different locations on Earth. This method relies on the geometric principle that the farther an object is, the smaller its apparent shift when observed from two different points.

However, the method was not applied to stars until the 19th century due to the extremely small angles involved. Friedrich Bessel was the first to successfully measure the parallax of a star, 61 Cygni, in 1838. Bessel's achievement provided the first direct and reliable measurement of the distance to a star other than the Sun.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
<b>Example:</b> Calculate the distance to a star with a parallax angle of 0.1 arcseconds. 
</div>

> Using the formula: 
>
> $$ \text{Distance (parsecs)} = \frac{1}{\text{parallax (arcseconds)}} $$
> $$ \text{Distance} = \frac{1}{0.1} = 10 \text{ parsecs} $$
>
> To convert parsecs to light-years, use the conversion factor: 
> $$ 1 \text{ parsec} = 3.26 \text{ light-years} $$
> $$ 10 \text{ parsecs} = 10 \times 3.26 = 32.6 \text{ light-years} $$

## The Milky Way Galaxy

The Milky Way is our galaxy, a massive collection of stars, gas, and dust bound together by gravity. It contains between 100 to 400 billion stars, including our Sun. Our solar system is located in one of the spiral arms of the Milky Way, about 27,000 light-years from the galactic center. The Milky Way itself is about 100,000 light-years in diameter.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teaghan/astronomy-12/main/Unit1/figures/Star_Cluster.png" alt="Star Cluster" width="1000" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

---

## The Local Group and Other Galaxies

The Milky Way is part of a larger collection of galaxies known as the Local Group, which contains about 54 galaxies. The Andromeda Galaxy, approximately 2.5 million light-years away, is the closest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way. Galaxies come in various shapes and sizes, including spiral, elliptical, and irregular.

> **Did You Know?**
> The Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way are on a collision course and are expected to merge in about 4.5 billion years to form a new galaxy, sometimes dubbed "Milkomeda."

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teaghan/astronomy-12/main/Unit1/figures/Closest_Spiral_Galaxy.png" alt="Closest Spiral Galaxy" width="1000" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

---

## The Observable Universe

Beyond the Local Group lies the observable universe, a vast expanse containing billions of galaxies. The observable universe is about 93 billion light-years in diameter. Superclusters and voids are large-scale structures within the universe, with superclusters containing thousands of galaxies.

> **Interesting Side Note**:
> The Hubble Deep Field image, taken in the mid-1990s, revealed over 1,500 galaxies in a tiny area of the sky, approximately one two-millionth of the night sky. This image showed the immense scale and richness of the universe.

## Methods of Measurement

Astronomers use various methods to measure distances in the universe, each suited to different scales and types of objects:

1. **Parallax**:
   - **Useful For**: Measuring distances to nearby stars within a few hundred light-years.
   - **How It Works**: Observes the apparent movement of a star against the background of more distant stars as Earth orbits the Sun. The parallax angle is half the angle that a star appears to move over six months. This method is most effective for stars relatively close to us.
   - **Further Insight**: Parallax measurements become increasingly difficult for stars that are farther away due to the very small angles involved. Advanced instruments, such as the Gaia space observatory, have significantly improved the accuracy of parallax measurements, enabling the mapping of stars up to tens of thousands of light-years away.

2. **Standard Candles**:
   - **Useful For**: Measuring distances to stars and galaxies up to tens of millions of light-years away.
   - **How It Works**: Uses objects with known luminosity, such as Cepheid variables and Type Ia supernovae, to determine distance based on their observed brightness. By comparing the known intrinsic brightness with the observed brightness, the distance to the object can be calculated.
   - **Further Insight**: Cepheid variables have a well-defined relationship between their luminosity and pulsation period, making them reliable distance indicators. Type Ia supernovae, known for their consistent peak brightness, are used to measure distances to faraway galaxies.

3. **Redshift**:
   - **Useful For**: Measuring distances to very distant galaxies and the overall scale of the universe.
   - **How It Works**: Measures the shift in the spectral lines of distant galaxies toward the red end of the spectrum. This redshift is due to the expansion of the universe and can be used to determine the galaxy's distance. The greater the redshift, the farther away the galaxy is.
   - **Further Insight**: Redshift measurements are fundamental to cosmology, providing crucial data for understanding the expansion rate of the universe (Hubble's Law) and the distribution of galaxies on a large scale.

## 1.3 The Celestial Sphere

### Introduction

Have you ever wondered why the stars seem to move across the sky each night, or why certain constellations are only visible during specific times of the year? To ancient astronomers, the heavens appeared as a vast, rotating dome with the Earth at its center. This imaginary dome, or celestial sphere, is a concept that has helped astronomers understand and describe the positions and movements of celestial objects for centuries. Today, we'll explore the celestial sphere and discover its significance in modern astronomy.

### The Celestial Sphere

Imagine lying back on a clear night, gazing up at the stars. It feels as if you are inside a gigantic, hollow dome with the stars stuck onto its inner surface. This is the celestial sphere, an imaginary sphere of arbitrarily large radius, centered on the Earth, on which all celestial objects can be considered to lie. Although the celestial sphere is a simplification, it remains incredibly useful for locating stars, planets, and other celestial bodies in the sky.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-info">
<b>Tip:</b> Think of the celestial sphere as a giant globe surrounding the Earth, with stars projected onto its inner surface.

Key features of the celestial sphere include:

- **Zenith**: The point directly overhead.
- **Horizon**: The line where the sky appears to meet the Earth.
- **Celestial Poles**: Extensions of Earth's North and South Poles onto the celestial sphere.
- **Celestial Equator**: The projection of Earth's equator onto the celestial sphere.

### Celestial Poles and Celestial Equator

To understand the celestial sphere, imagine extending Earth's axis points into the sky. The points where this line intersects the celestial sphere are the north celestial pole and the south celestial pole. As Earth rotates about its axis, the sky appears to turn in the opposite direction around these celestial poles.

> The celestial equator divides the sky into the northern and southern celestial hemispheres, similar to how Earth's equator divides our planet.

For example, if you stood at the North Pole, you would see the north celestial pole overhead at your zenith. The celestial equator would lie along your horizon. As you watch the stars during the course of the night, they would all circle around the celestial pole, with none rising or setting. Conversely, at the equator, you would see the celestial equator pass overhead through your zenith, and the celestial poles at the north and south points on your horizon.

### Rising and Setting of the Sun

The Sun, Moon, and stars appear to rise in the east and set in the west due to Earth's rotation. This daily movement, known as diurnal motion, is one of the most familiar astronomical phenomena. The path the Sun appears to take across the celestial sphere over the course of a year is called the ecliptic. This path is inclined to the celestial equator due to the tilt of Earth's axis, leading to seasonal changes.

> Imagine standing in San Francisco, where the latitude is 38° N. The north celestial pole would be 38° above the northern horizon. As Earth turns, the whole sky seems to pivot about the north celestial pole. Stars within 38° of the North Pole never set, while stars within 38° of the south celestial pole never rise.

### Fixed and Wandering Stars

Ancient astronomers categorized celestial objects into "fixed stars" and "wandering stars." Fixed stars maintain fixed patterns relative to each other and form constellations. Wandering stars, known today as planets, move relative to the fixed stars.

The fixed stars include most of the stars we see in the night sky. They form patterns that have been recognized and named as constellations. These patterns appear to move across the sky in a predictable way each night and throughout the year, making them useful for navigation and timekeeping.

> The ancient Greeks called the planets "asteres planetai," which means "wandering stars." Unlike the fixed stars, the planets change their positions relative to the background stars over days, weeks, and months.

### Constellations

Constellations are patterns of stars that have been identified and named by various cultures throughout history. Today, astronomers recognize 88 constellations that divide the sky into sectors, making it easier to locate celestial objects.

The modern constellations are used not only to identify patterns of stars but also to define specific areas of the sky. Each constellation covers a region of the celestial sphere, so every point in the sky belongs to one of the 88 constellations. This system helps astronomers communicate about locations in the sky with precision.

> **Did You Know?** The modern meaning of a constellation includes not just the pattern of stars but also the region of the sky around it. For example, the constellation Orion is not just the familiar hunter figure but also the area of the sky where this pattern is found.

### Check Your Understanding

1. How many degrees does the Sun move per day relative to the fixed stars? How many days does it take for the Sun to return to its original location relative to the fixed stars?
<br><br>

2. The Moon's orbital period around Earth is approximately 27.3 days. How many degrees does the Moon move per day relative to the fixed stars? 
<br><br>

3. Is the ecliptic the same thing as the celestial equator? Explain.
<br><br>

4. Explain why more stars are circumpolar for observers at higher latitudes.
<br><br>

5. What is the altitude of the north celestial pole in the sky from your latitude? (The latitude of Salt Spring Island, BC is approximately 49 degrees N.)
<br><br>

6. Suppose you are on a strange planet and observe, at night, that the stars do not rise and set, but circle parallel to the horizon. Next, you walk in a constant direction for 8000 miles, and at your new location on the planet, you find that all stars rise straight up in the east and set straight down in the west, perpendicular to the horizon. How could you determine the circumference of the planet without any further observations? What is the circumference, in miles, of the planet?
