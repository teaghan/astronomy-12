### The Ancient Roots of Astronomy

> **Did You Know?**
> The ancient Babylonians were among the first to create detailed records of celestial events, which helped them develop a calendar and predict lunar eclipses.

Our story begins in ancient Babylon and Egypt, where early astronomers meticulously observed the skies. These civilizations recorded the movements of celestial bodies, using their observations to predict events like eclipses and the flooding of the Nile. The Babylonians developed star catalogs, while the Egyptians created a 365-day calendar based on the heliacal rising of Sirius.

| Civilization | Key Contributions                                         |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Babylon      | Star catalogs, lunar eclipse predictions                  |
| Egypt        | 365-day calendar based on Sirius                          |
| Greece       | Mathematical harmony, spherical Earth, Ptolemaic model    |
| Mayans       | Accurate calendars, predictions of solar and lunar cycles |
| Chinese      | Earliest recorded supernova, detailed star maps           |

As we move forward in time, we encounter the Greeks, who made significant contributions to our understanding of the cosmos. Pythagoras proposed a mathematical harmony in nature, influencing later cosmologies. Aristotle argued for a spherical Earth, based on the shape of Earth's shadow during lunar eclipses.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teaghan/astronomy-12/main/Unit1/figures/Aristotle.png" alt="Aristotle Image" width="1000" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

Eratosthenes, a brilliant mathematician, measured Earth's circumference with remarkable accuracy using the angles of shadows in different locations.

In Alexandria, Claudius Ptolemy developed the geocentric model, which placed Earth at the center of the universe, with planets and stars orbiting it in complex patterns of circles within circles. This model dominated astronomical thought for over a thousand years.

<img src="https://github.com/teaghan/astronomy-12/blob/main/Unit1/figures/Ptolemy.png?raw=true" alt="Ptolemy Image" width="1000" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

### The Copernican Revolution

The scene shifts to Renaissance Europe, where a quiet revolution was brewing. Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish astronomer, proposed a heliocentric model that placed the Sun at the center of the universe. This radical idea challenged the long-held geocentric model and set the stage for a seismic shift in our understanding of the cosmos.

> **Interesting Side Note**:
> Copernicus hesitated to publish his work due to fear of criticism and persecution. His groundbreaking book, "De revolutionibus orbium coelestium," was published just before his death in 1543.

<img src="https://github.com/teaghan/astronomy-12/blob/main/Unit1/figures/Copernicus.png?raw=true" alt="Copernicus Image" width="1000" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

Enter Galileo Galilei, the Italian polymath who used a telescope to observe the heavens like never before. Galileo discovered moons orbiting Jupiter and phases of Venus, providing concrete evidence for the heliocentric model. His findings sparked a clash with the Catholic Church, illustrating the tension between science and established beliefs.

<img src="https://github.com/teaghan/astronomy-12/blob/main/Unit1/figures/Galileo.png?raw=true" alt="Galileo Image" width="1000" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

Johannes Kepler, a contemporary of Galileo, formulated three laws of planetary motion, describing the orbits of planets as ellipses rather than circles. Kepler's laws revolutionized our understanding of planetary motion and paved the way for further discoveries.

### The Birth of Modern Astronomy

Our journey continues into the 18th century with William Herschel, who discovered Uranus and used large telescopes to catalog thousands of stars and nebulae. Herschel's work expanded our understanding of the cosmos and revealed the vastness of the universe.

The development of spectroscopy in the 19th century marked a new era in astronomy. Joseph Fraunhofer discovered dark lines in the solar spectrum, leading to the identification of chemical elements in stars. Gustav Kirchhoff and Robert Bunsen further advanced this field, allowing astronomers to determine the composition of stars and other celestial bodies.

# 1.2 The Scale of the Universe

## Introduction

In the winter of 1995, scientists pointed the Hubble Space Telescope at a seemingly empty patch of sky near the Big Dipper. Over ten consecutive days, the telescope took close to 150 hours of exposure of this dark, unobtrusive spot. What came back was nothing short of spectacular: an image of over 1,500 distinct galaxies glimmering in a tiny sliver of the universe. This was just a fraction of the sky, about the size of a ballpoint pen tip held at arm's length, revealing an incredible truth about the vastness of our cosmos. This lesson will explore the immense scales of the universe, from our solar system to the farthest reaches observed by humanity, illustrating the vast distances and sizes that define our universe.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-success">
  <h4>Video</h4>
  <p>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYQ3O8U6SMY" target="_blank">this video</a> for a discussion on the scale of the universe. It includes the distances and sizes of celestial objects and provides a visual representation of the concepts covered in this lesson.</p>
</div>

---

## Scientific Notation

To understand the vast distances and sizes in the universe, we need to use scientific notation. This method allows us to express very large and very small numbers in a manageable way. For example, the distance from the Earth to the Sun is about 150,000,000 kilometers, which can be written as $1.5 \times 10^8$ kilometers.

> One way to think of scientific notation is to think of how many digits to you have to move the decimal place (postivie exponents to the right, negative exponents to the left). For example, $3.8 \times 10^{3}=3800$, whereas $3.8 \times 10^{-3}=0.0038$

---

## The Size and Scale of the Solar System

The solar system is our cosmic neighborhood, and its scale is immense. The Sun, the central star, has a diameter of about 1.4 million kilometers. Earth, the third planet from the Sun, has a diameter of about 12,700 kilometers. The average distance from Earth to the Sun is approximately 150 million kilometers, also known as 1 Astronomical Unit (AU).

> 1 Astronomical Unit (AU) is equivalent to $1.496 \times 10^{11}$ meters.

Imagine if the Sun were the size of a basketball. In this model, Earth would be a small apple seed 30 meters away.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teaghan/astronomy-12/main/Unit1/figures/Our_Solar_Family.png" alt="Our Solar Family" width="1000" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

---

## Interstellar Distances

Beyond our solar system, the distances between objects become even more staggering. A light-year, the distance light travels in one year, is about 9.46 trillion kilometers. The nearest star to the Sun, Proxima Centauri, is approximately 4.24 light-years away.


> **Derivation of a Light Year**:
> 
> Light travels at a speed of approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (km/s) in a vacuum.
> There are 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 24 hours in a day.
>
> $$ \text{Speed of light} = 299,792 \, \text{km/s} $$
>
> $$ \text{Seconds in a minute} = 60 $$
>
> $$ \text{Minutes in an hour} = 60 $$
>
> $$ \text{Hours in a day} = 24 $$
>
> $$ \text{Days in a year} = 365.25 $$
>
> To find the distance light travels in one year:
>
> $$ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} $$
>
> First, calculate the number of seconds in a year:
>
> $$ 60 \times 60 \times 24 \times 365.25 \approx 31,557,600 \, \text{seconds/year} $$
>
> Then, multiply the speed of light by the number of seconds in a year:
>
> $$ 299,792 \, \text{km/s} \times 31,557,600 \, \text{s/year} \approx 9.46 \times 10^{12} \, \text{kilometers/year} $$
>
> Therefore, one light-year is approximately 9.46 trillion kilometers.


### Parallax: Measuring Stellar Distances

Parallax is a method used to measure the distances to nearby stars by observing their apparent movement against the background of more distant stars as Earth orbits the Sun. The parallax angle is half the angle that a star appears to move over six months.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teaghan/astronomy-12/main/Unit1/figures/Parallax.png" alt="Parallax" width="1000" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

### Development of Parallax

The concept of parallax dates back to ancient Greece, where Hipparchus, a Greek astronomer, used it to estimate the distance to the Moon around 150 BCE. Hipparchus observed the apparent shift in the position of the Moon against the background stars when viewed from different locations on Earth. This method relies on the geometric principle that the farther an object is, the smaller its apparent shift when observed from two different points.

However, the method was not applied to stars until the 19th century due to the extremely small angles involved. Friedrich Bessel was the first to successfully measure the parallax of a star, 61 Cygni, in 1838. Bessel's achievement provided the first direct and reliable measurement of the distance to a star other than the Sun.

### What is Parallax?

Parallax is the apparent displacement of an object because of a change in the observer's point of view. In astronomy, it specifically refers to the apparent shift of a star's position against the background of distant stars due to Earth's orbit around the Sun. This shift can be measured at different points in Earth's orbit, six months apart, to form the maximum parallax angle.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-success">
  <h4>Video</h4>
  <p>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUQAIldqPww" target="_blank">this video</a> for an more thorough explanation on parallax.</p>
</div>

### Arcseconds and Parsecs

**Arcseconds:** When measuring parallax angles, astronomers use very small units called arcseconds. One arcsecond is \(1/3600\) of a degree. Because the angles involved in stellar parallax are so tiny, using arcseconds allows for more precise measurement. 

**Parsecs:** The distance to a star can be determined using its parallax angle. A parsec (pc) is defined as the distance at which a star would have a parallax angle of one arcsecond. It is derived from the formula:

$$
\text{Distance (parsecs)} = \frac{1}{\text{parallax (arcseconds)}}
$$

> One parsec is approximately equal to 3.26 light-years. This unit of measurement is especially useful in astronomy for calculating vast interstellar distances.


**More angle units**: In addition to arcseconds, astronomers also use arcminutes and hours to measure angles and time. One arcminute is $\frac{1}{60}$ of a degree, and one hour is $\frac{1}{24}$ of a day.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
<b>Example:</b> Calculate the distance to a star with a parallax angle of 0.1 arcseconds. 
</div>

> Using the formula: 
>
> $$ \text{Distance (parsecs)} = \frac{1}{\text{parallax (arcseconds)}} $$
> $$ \text{Distance} = \frac{1}{0.1} = 10 \text{ parsecs} $$
>
> To convert parsecs to light-years, use the conversion factor: 
> $$ 1 \text{ parsec} = 3.26 \text{ light-years} $$
> $$ 10 \text{ parsecs} = 10 \times 3.26 = 32.6 \text{ light-years} $$

### Applications and Limitations

Parallax is a fundamental method for measuring distances to nearby stars **within a few hundred light-years from Earth**. Beyond this range, the parallax angles become too small to measure accurately with current technology. However, advancements in space telescopes, like the Gaia mission, have significantly increased the precision of parallax measurements, allowing astronomers to map stars up to tens of thousands of light-years away.

## The Milky Way Galaxy

The Milky Way is our galaxy, a massive collection of stars, gas, and dust bound together by gravity. It contains between 100 to 400 billion stars, including our Sun. Our solar system is located in one of the spiral arms of the Milky Way, about 27,000 light-years from the galactic center. The Milky Way itself is about 100,000 light-years in diameter.

---

## The Local Group and Other Galaxies

The Milky Way is part of a larger collection of galaxies known as the Local Group, which contains about 54 galaxies. The Andromeda Galaxy, approximately 2.5 million light-years away, is the closest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way. Galaxies come in various shapes and sizes, including spiral, elliptical, and irregular.

> **Did You Know?**
> The Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way are on a collision course and are expected to merge in about 4.5 billion years to form a new galaxy, sometimes dubbed "Milkomeda."

---

## The Observable Universe

Beyond the Local Group lies the observable universe, a vast expanse containing billions of galaxies. The observable universe is about 93 billion light-years in diameter. Superclusters and voids are large-scale structures within the universe, with superclusters containing thousands of galaxies.

> **Interesting Side Note**:
> The Hubble Deep Field image, taken in the mid-1990s, revealed over 1,500 galaxies in a tiny area of the sky, approximately one two-millionth of the night sky. This image showed the immense scale and richness of the universe.

## Methods of Measurement

In this lesson, we studied the use of parallax to measure interstellar distances.

Astronomers use various other methods to measure distances in the universe, each suited to different scales and types of objects. We will study these more throughout the course.

1. **Parallax**:
   - **Useful For**: Measuring distances to nearby stars within a few hundred light-years.
   - **How It Works**: Observes the apparent movement of a star against the background of more distant stars as Earth orbits the Sun. The parallax angle is half the angle that a star appears to move over six months. This method is most effective for stars relatively close to us.
   - **Further Insight**: Parallax measurements become increasingly difficult for stars that are farther away due to the very small angles involved. Advanced instruments, such as the Gaia space observatory, have significantly improved the accuracy of parallax measurements, enabling the mapping of stars up to tens of thousands of light-years away.

2. **Standard Candles**:
   - **Useful For**: Measuring distances to stars and galaxies up to tens of millions of light-years away.
   - **How It Works**: Uses objects with known luminosity, such as Cepheid variables and Type Ia supernovae, to determine distance based on their observed brightness. By comparing the known intrinsic brightness with the observed brightness, the distance to the object can be calculated.
   - **Further Insight**: Cepheid variables have a well-defined relationship between their luminosity and pulsation period, making them reliable distance indicators. Type Ia supernovae, known for their consistent peak brightness, are used to measure distances to faraway galaxies.

3. **Redshift**:
   - **Useful For**: Measuring distances to very distant galaxies and the overall scale of the universe.
   - **How It Works**: Measures the shift in the spectral lines of distant galaxies toward the red end of the spectrum. This redshift is due to the expansion of the universe and can be used to determine the galaxy's distance. The greater the redshift, the farther away the galaxy is.
   - **Further Insight**: Redshift measurements are fundamental to cosmology, providing crucial data for understanding the expansion rate of the universe (Hubble's Law) and the distribution of galaxies on a large scale.

# 1.3 The Celestial Sphere

### Introduction

Have you ever wondered why the stars seem to move across the sky each night, or why certain constellations are only visible during specific times of the year? To ancient astronomers, the heavens appeared as a vast, rotating dome with the Earth at its center. This imaginary dome, or *celestial sphere*, is a concept that has helped astronomers understand and describe the positions and movements of celestial objects for centuries. Today, we'll explore the celestial sphere and discover its significance in modern astronomy.

</div>

---

### The Celestial Sphere

Imagine lying back on a clear night, gazing up at the stars. It feels as if you are inside a gigantic, hollow dome with the stars stuck onto its inner surface. This is the celestial sphere, an imaginary sphere of arbitrarily large radius, centered on the Earth, on which all celestial objects can be considered to lie. Although the celestial sphere is a simplification, it remains incredibly useful for locating stars, planets, and other celestial bodies in the sky.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-info">
<b>Tip:</b> Think of the celestial sphere as a giant globe surrounding the Earth, with stars projected onto its inner surface.
</div>

Key features of the celestial sphere include:

- **Zenith**: The point directly overhead.
- **Horizon**: The line where the sky appears to meet the Earth.
- **Celestial Poles**: Extensions of Earth's North and South Poles onto the celestial sphere.
- **Celestial Equator**: The projection of Earth's equator onto the celestial sphere.

---

### Celestial Poles and Celestial Equator

To understand the celestial sphere, imagine extending Earth's axis points into the sky. The points where this line intersects the celestial sphere are the north celestial pole and the south celestial pole. As Earth rotates about its axis, the sky appears to turn in the opposite direction around these celestial poles.

> The celestial equator divides the sky into the northern and southern celestial hemispheres, similar to how Earth's equator divides our planet.

For example, if you stood at the North Pole, you would see the north celestial pole overhead at your zenith. The celestial equator would lie along your horizon. As you watch the stars during the course of the night, they would all circle around the celestial pole, with none rising or setting. Conversely, at the equator, you would see the celestial equator pass overhead through your zenith, and the celestial poles at the north and south points on your horizon.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teaghan/astronomy-12/main/Unit1/figures/Figure2_3.png" alt="Circles on the Celestial Sphere" width="1000" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

---

### Rising and Setting of the Sun

The Sun, Moon, and stars appear to rise in the east and set in the west due to Earth's rotation. This daily movement, known as diurnal motion, is one of the most familiar astronomical phenomena. The path the Sun appears to take across the celestial sphere over the course of a year is called the ecliptic. This path is inclined to the celestial equator due to the tilt of Earth's axis, leading to seasonal changes.

> Imagine standing in San Francisco, where the latitude is 38° N. The north celestial pole would be 38° above the northern horizon. As Earth turns, the whole sky seems to pivot about the north celestial pole. Stars within 38° of the North Pole never set, while stars within 38° of the south celestial pole never rise.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teaghan/astronomy-12/main/Unit1/figures/Figure2_7.png" alt="The Celestial Tilt" width="1000" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

---

### Fixed and Wandering Stars

Ancient astronomers categorized celestial objects into "fixed stars" and "wandering stars." Fixed stars maintain fixed patterns relative to each other and form constellations. Wandering stars, known today as planets, move relative to the fixed stars.

The fixed stars include most of the stars we see in the night sky. They form patterns that have been recognized and named as constellations. These patterns appear to move across the sky in a predictable way each night and throughout the year, making them useful for navigation and timekeeping.

> The ancient Greeks called the planets "asteres planetai," which means "wandering stars." Unlike the fixed stars, the planets change their positions relative to the background stars over days, weeks, and months.

---

### Constellations

Constellations are patterns of stars that have been identified and named by various cultures throughout history. Today, astronomers recognize 88 constellations that divide the sky into sectors, making it easier to locate celestial objects.

The modern constellations are used not only to identify patterns of stars but also to define specific areas of the sky. Each constellation covers a region of the celestial sphere, so every point in the sky belongs to one of the 88 constellations. This system helps astronomers communicate about locations in the sky with precision.

> **Did You Know?** The modern meaning of a constellation includes not just the pattern of stars but also the region of the sky around it. For example, the constellation Orion is not just the familiar hunter figure but also the area of the sky where this pattern is found.

# 1.4 The Brightness of Stars

## Introduction

Have you ever gazed up at the night sky and wondered why some stars shine brighter than others? The study of stellar brightness not only allows us to appreciate the beauty of the cosmos but also provides crucial information about the stars themselves. In this lesson, we'll explore how astronomers measure the brightness of stars, the physics behind their luminosity, and the historical context of the magnitude scale.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-success">
  <h4>Video</h4>
  <p>Watch <a href="https://youtu.be/JIXFXGiDa4Y?si=x7IidSPRQEKKfjgL" target="_blank">this video</a> for an excellent overview of the brightness of stars, including practical examples and historical context.</p>
</div>

---

### Flux and Luminosity

To understand stellar brightness, we first need to define a few key concepts: flux and luminosity.

**Flux** is the amount of light energy received per unit area per unit time. Imagine standing under a streetlamp at night. The light that hits you is the flux.

**Luminosity**, on the other hand, is the total amount of energy a star emits per unit time. Think of it as the star's total power output.

### The Inverse Square Law

As light travels from a star, it spreads out over an ever-increasing area. This spreading out follows the **Inverse Square Law**, which states that the flux decreases with the square of the distance from the source. Mathematically, we express this as:

$$ F = \frac{L}{4\pi r^2} $$

where:
- $F$ is the flux (in watts per square meter, $\text{W/m}^2$),
- $L$ is the luminosity (in watts, $\text{W}$),
- $r$ is the distance from the star (in meters, $\text{m}$).

> This law explains why stars appear dimmer the farther away they are. It's not because they're less powerful, but because their light spreads out over a larger area.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
<b>Example:</b> Calculating the Solar Flux at Different Distances
</div>

> The luminosity of the Sun is $ 3.839 \times 10^{26} $ W and is at a distance of 1 AU (astronomical unit) away from Earth, which is $ 1.496 \times 10^{11} $ meters.

> > $$ F = \frac{3.839 \times 10^{26}}{4\pi (1.496 \times 10^{11})^2} $$
> > 
> > $$ F \approx 1365 \, \text{W/m}^2 $$
>
>This value of the solar flux is known as the **solar irradiance**, sometimes also called the solar constant.

---

## Apparent Brightness and the Magnitude Scale

### Apparent Magnitude

The **apparent magnitude** of a star is a measure of its brightness as seen from Earth. This concept is crucial because it takes into account both the intrinsic luminosity of the star and its distance from us.

### Historical Background of the Magnitude Scale

The magnitude scale dates back to the ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus, who classified stars according to their apparent brightness. This system was refined by Ptolemy and later standardized to a logarithmic scale, where a difference of 5 magnitudes corresponds to a factor of 100 in brightness.

The logarithmic nature of the scale is represented by:

$$ m_1 - m_2 = -2.5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{F_1}{F_2} \right) $$

where $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ are the magnitudes of two stars, and $ F_1 $ and $ F_2 $ are their respective fluxes.

Another way to write this equation is:

$$ \frac{F_2}{F_1} = \left(100^{0.2}\right)^{m_1 - m_2} $$

which allows us to compare the flux of two objects (and the flux is what we would typically call "brightness" in every day conversation).

> The star Vega was historically used as the standard for apparent magnitude, set at 0. Modern measurements have slightly adjusted this value, but Vega remains a key reference point in the magnitude system.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-info">
<b>Recall:</b> A logarithm is a mathematical operator that tells us the power to which a base number must be raised to obtain a given number. When the base is not specified, it is assumed to be 10.
</div>

> For example, $ \log_{10}(100) = 2 $ because $ 10^2 = 100 $.

Logarithmic scales are used in astronomy to manage the huge differences in the brightness and distances of celestial objects.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teaghan/astronomy-12/main/Unit1/figures/Apparent_Magnitudes.png" alt="Apparent Magnitudes of Well-Known Objects" width="1000" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
<b>Example:</b> Suppose an astronomer has discovered something special about a dim star with a magnitude of 8.5 and wants to explain how much dimmer this star is compared to Sirius. We'll use the dim star as Star 1 and Sirius as Star 2 in our equation.
</div>

> Given:
> 
> > Dim star magnitude, $ m_1 = 8.5 $
> > 
> > Sirius magnitude, $ m_2 = -1.5 $
> 
> Solution:
> 
> > $$ \frac{F_2}{F_1} = \left(100^{0.2}\right)^{8.5 - (-1.5)} $$
> > 
> > $$ \frac{F_2}{F_1} = \left(100^{0.2}\right)^{10} $$
> > 
> > $$ \frac{F_2}{F_1} = (100)^2 = 100 \times 100 = 10,000 $$
> > 
> > Therefore, the dim star is 10,000 times dimmer than Sirius.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
<b>Example:</b> It is a common misconception that Polaris (magnitude 2.0) is the brightest star in the sky. However, Sirius, with a magnitude of -1.5, holds that title. Let's compare the apparent brightness of Sirius to Polaris.
</div>

> Given:
> 
> > Polaris magnitude, $ m_1 = 2.0 $
> > 
> > Sirius magnitude, $ m_2 = -1.5 $
> 
> Solution:
> 
> > $$ \frac{F_2}{F_1} = \left(100^{0.2}\right)^{2.0 - (-1.5)} $$
> > 
> > $$ \frac{F_2}{F_1} = \left(100^{0.2}\right)^{3.5} $$
> > 
> > $$ \frac{F_2}{F_1} = 100^{0.7} = 25 $$
> 
> Our calculation shows that Sirius’ apparent brightness is 25 times greater than Polaris’ apparent brightness.

## Absolute Magnitude

Absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude (brightness) a star would have if it were placed at a standard distance of 10 parsecs from Earth. This standardization allows astronomers to compare the true brightness of stars without the confounding effect of distance.

The relationship between a star's absolute magnitude $ M $, apparent magnitude $ m $, and distance $ d $ in parsecs is given by:

$$ M = m + 5 - 5 \log_{10}(d) $$

---

## Distance Modulus

### Explanation of Distance Modulus

The **distance modulus** provides a way to calculate the distance to a star based on its apparent and absolute magnitudes. The formula is:

$$ m - M = 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5 $$

where:
- $ m $ is the apparent magnitude,
- $ M $ is the absolute magnitude,
- $ d $ is the distance in parsecs.

This equation is incredibly useful for determining stellar distances, making it a cornerstone of astronomical measurement.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
<b>Example:</b> Calculating the Absolute Magnitude of the Sun
</div>

> The apparent magnitude of the Sun, $ m_{\text{Sun}} $, is $ -26.83 $, and its distance from Earth is 1 AU, which is $ 4.848 \times 10^{-6} $ parsecs. Using the formula for absolute magnitude:
> 
> $$ M_{\text{Sun}} = m_{\text{Sun}} - 5 \log_{10}(d) + 5 $$
> 
> we can calculate the absolute magnitude of the Sun.
> 
> $$ M_{\text{Sun}} = m_{\text{Sun}} - 5 \log_{10}(d) + 5 $$
> 
> $$ M_{\text{Sun}} = -26.83 - 5 \log_{10}(4.848 \times 10^{-6}) + 5 $$
> 
> Since $ \log_{10}(4.848 \times 10^{-6}) \approx -5.315 $:
> 
> $$ M_{\text{Sun}} = -26.83 - 5(-5.315) + 5 $$
> 
> $$ M_{\text{Sun}} = -26.83 + 26.575 + 5 $$
> 
> $$ M_{\text{Sun}} = 4.74 $$
>
>> Thus, the absolute magnitude of the Sun is $ +4.74 $.

# 1.5 Consequences of Light Travel Time

## Introduction

Imagine looking up at the night sky and seeing stars that are no longer there. This isn't a sci-fi movie plot but a fascinating consequence of light travel time. When we look at the stars, we see them not as they are now, but as they were in the past. This phenomenon arises because light takes time to travel across the vast distances of space. Understanding light travel time not only helps us measure cosmic distances but also allows us to peer back into the history of the universe.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-success">
  <h4>Video</h4>
  <p>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MohKd8vSdBA" target="_blank">this video</a> for a deeper understanding of light travel time and its implications in astronomy. This video explains the fundamental concepts and fascinating consequences of observing the universe through the lens of light travel time.</p>
</div>

---

## Historical Context

> **Did You Know?** Early theories about the speed of light date back to ancient India. Scholars in the 14th century speculated that light might travel like wind. Although they couldn't prove it, their calculations were surprisingly close to modern measurements of the speed of light.

### Key Historical Contributions

- **Ole Rømer**: In 1676, Rømer was the first to demonstrate that light travels at a finite speed by observing the moons of Jupiter. He noticed discrepancies in the timings of the eclipses of Jupiter's moons, which he attributed to the varying distance between Earth and Jupiter as both planets orbited the Sun.
- **Albert A. Michelson**: In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Michelson's experiments refined the measurement of the speed of light to its modern value. Using rotating mirrors and precise timing devices, he determined the speed of light with remarkable accuracy.

### The Speed of Light

The most important point to remember is that light travels at a constant speed in a vacuum, approximately 299,792 kilometers per second. This immense speed still takes time to cover the vast distances in space. 

> Light from the Sun takes about 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach Earth. When you look at the Sun, you see it as it was over 8 minutes ago.

---

## Measuring Distances in Astronomy

Light travel time is crucial in measuring astronomical distances. By knowing how fast light travels, we can determine how far away celestial objects are.

### Concepts of Light-Years and Parsecs

Recall these concepts from a previous lesson:

- **Light-Year**: The distance light travels in one year, approximately 9.46 trillion kilometers. It's a convenient unit for expressing astronomical distances because it directly relates to the speed of light.
- **Parsec**: A unit of distance used in astronomy, equivalent to about 3.26 light-years. One parsec is the distance at which one astronomical unit subtends an angle of one arcsecond.

### Techniques for Measuring Distances

- **Parallax**: By observing the apparent shift in a star's position as Earth orbits the Sun, astronomers can calculate its distance. The greater the shift, the closer the star is.

- **Standard Candles**: These are astronomical objects with a known luminosity. By comparing the known luminosity of these objects to their observed brightness, astronomers can calculate their distance. Here are two main types of standard candles:

  1. **Cepheid Variables**:
     - Cepheid variables are stars that pulsate in a regular cycle. The period of their pulsation is directly related to their luminosity; this relationship is known as the period-luminosity relation.
     - By observing the period of a Cepheid variable, astronomers can determine its true luminosity. Comparing this with the apparent brightness (how bright it appears from Earth) allows astronomers to calculate the distance to the star.
     - Cepheid variables are crucial for measuring distances to nearby galaxies and are often used to establish the distance scale of the universe.

  2. **Type Ia Supernovae**:
     - Type Ia supernovae occur in binary systems where a white dwarf accretes material from its companion star until it reaches a critical mass and explodes.
     - These supernovae have a consistent peak luminosity, making them excellent standard candles for measuring cosmic distances.
     - Because they are incredibly bright, Type Ia supernovae can be observed in distant galaxies, allowing astronomers to measure vast distances across the universe.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
<b>Example:</b> Imagine astronomers observe a Cepheid variable star in a nearby galaxy. The observed apparent magnitude of the star is 15.2, and its absolute magnitude is known to be -3.4. Calculate the distance to the Cepheid variable star.
</div>

> **Solution**:
>
> 1. **Formula**: The distance modulus formula relates the apparent magnitude ($m$) and absolute magnitude ($M$) of a star to its distance in parsecs ($d$):
>    $$
>    m - M = 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5
>    $$
> 2. **Rearrange the Formula to Solve for Distance**:
>    $$
>    m - M + 5 = 5 \log_{10}(d)
>    $$
>    $$
>    \frac{m - M + 5}{5} = \log_{10}(d)
>    $$
>    $$
>    d = 10^{\left( \frac{m - M + 5}{5} \right)}
>    $$
> 3. **Substitute the Given Values**: $m = 15.2$, $M = -3.4$
>    $$
>    d = 10^{\left( \frac{15.2 - (-3.4) + 5}{5} \right)}
>    $$
>    $$
>    d = 10^{\left( \frac{15.2 + 3.4 + 5}{5} \right)}
>    $$
>    $$
>    d = 10^{\left( \frac{23.6}{5} \right)}
>    $$
>    $$
>    d = 10^{4.72}
>    $$
> 4. **Calculate the Distance**:
>    $$
>    d \approx 52,480 \text{ parsecs}
>    $$
> 
>> Therefore, the distance to the Cepheid variable star is approximately 52,480 parsecs.

---

This example uses the distance modulus formula to calculate the distance to a Cepheid variable star, incorporating the given apparent and absolute magnitudes. This approach helps students apply their knowledge of standard candles and the distance modulus in a practical scenario.

## Observable Universe and Light Travel Time

When we observe distant galaxies, we are looking back in time. This concept is fundamental to understanding the observable universe.

### Observing the Past

- **Light from the Past**: The light from distant stars and galaxies takes millions or even billions of years to reach us. Thus, we see these objects as they were in the distant past. For example, when you see the Andromeda Galaxy, you're seeing it as it was about 2.5 million years ago.
- **Cosmic Horizon**: The farthest we can see is limited by the age of the universe and the speed of light. This boundary is known as the cosmic horizon. Beyond this, the light hasn't had enough time to reach us since the beginning of the universe.

### Implications for Astronomy

Observing the past allows astronomers to study the evolution of the universe, including the formation of galaxies, stars, and other cosmic phenomena. It provides a unique window into the history of the cosmos, allowing us to understand how it has changed over billions of years.

> **Interesting Side Note**: The Hubble Space Telescope has observed galaxies as they were just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, providing a glimpse into the early universe.

---

## Astronomical Phenomena and Light Travel Time

### Supernovae

When a star explodes as a supernova, the light from the explosion can take years to reach us. By studying these explosions, astronomers can learn about the life cycles of stars. For instance, the supernova observed in the Large Magellanic Cloud in 1987 (SN 1987A) provided invaluable insights into the processes occurring at the end of a star's life.

### Space Observations

- **Hubble Space Telescope**: In 2016, Hubble observed a galaxy 32 billion light-years away. Due to the expanding universe, we see this galaxy as it was 13.4 billion years ago, offering a glimpse into the early stages of galaxy formation.

- **James Webb Space Telescope**: Set to revolutionize our understanding by observing in the infrared spectrum, allowing us to see even further back in time. This telescope will help us study the formation of the first stars and galaxies, pushing the boundaries of our knowledge about the early universe.

## Summary Notes

For each unit, the students will be given a "Graphic Organizer" document, which will serve as a self-designed summary for the unit. The organizer will have boxes for students to fill with notes, diagrams, and examples for a selected set of topics. There will be a suggested set of topics as well as empty boxes to give students the opportunity to summarize additional topics.

When the main instructor asks the assistant to create a set of summary notes for the unit, the assistant will develop and run the python code required to generate a docx file. The example below should be **followed exactly**, only changing the `heading`, `contents`, and the `doc_path` to suit the particular unit that is being discussed.

```python
from docx import Document
from docx.shared import Inches

def create_document_adjusted(heading, contents, doc_path):
    # Create a new Document
    doc = Document()

    # Define page properties
    page_margin = 0.5  # in inches

    # Set page margins
    for section in doc.sections:
        section.top_margin = Inches(page_margin)
        section.bottom_margin = Inches(page_margin)
        section.left_margin = Inches(page_margin)
        section.right_margin = Inches(page_margin)

    # Insert a new paragraph for the heading at the beginning of the document
    doc.add_paragraph(heading, style='Heading 1')
