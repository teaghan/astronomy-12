# BC Science Curriculum

## Physics 11

### Big Ideas

- An object’s motion can be predicted, analyzed, and described.
- Forces influence the motion of an object.
- Energy is found in different forms, is conserved, and has the ability to do work.
- Mechanical waves transfer energy but not matter.

### Curricular Competencies

Students are expected to be able to do the following:

#### Questioning and predicting

- Demonstrate a sustained intellectual curiosity about a scientific topic or problem of personal, local, or global interest
- Make observations aimed at identifying their own questions, including increasingly abstract ones, about the natural world
- Formulate multiple hypotheses and predict multiple outcomes

#### Planning and conducting

- Collaboratively and individually plan, select, and use appropriate investigation methods, including field work and lab experiments, to collect reliable data (qualitative and quantitative)
- Assess risks and address ethical, cultural, and/or environmental issues associated with their proposed methods
- Use appropriate SI units and appropriate equipment, including digital technologies, to systematically and accurately collect and record data
- Apply the concepts of accuracy and precision to experimental procedures and data:
  - significant figures
  - uncertainty
  - scientific notation

#### Processing and analyzing data and information

- Experience and interpret the local environment
- Apply First Peoples perspectives and knowledge, other ways of knowing, and local knowledge as sources of information
- Seek and analyze patterns, trends, and connections in data, including describing relationships between variables, performing calculations, and identifying inconsistencies
- Construct, analyze, and interpret graphs, models, and/or diagrams
- Use knowledge of scientific concepts to draw conclusions that are consistent with evidence
- Analyze cause-and-effect relationships

#### Evaluating

- Evaluate their methods and experimental conditions, including identifying sources of error or uncertainty, confounding variables, and possible alternative explanations and conclusions
- Describe specific ways to improve their investigation methods and the quality of their data
- Evaluate the validity and limitations of a model or analogy in relation to the phenomenon modeled
- Demonstrate an awareness of assumptions, question information given, and identify bias in their own work and in primary and secondary sources
- Consider the changes in knowledge over time as tools and technologies have developed
- Connect scientific explorations to careers in science
- Exercise a healthy, informed skepticism and use scientific knowledge and findings to form their own investigations to evaluate claims in primary and secondary sources
- Consider social, ethical, and environmental implications of the findings from their own and others’ investigations
- Critically analyze the validity of information in primary and secondary sources and evaluate the approaches used to solve problems
- Assess risks in the context of personal safety and social responsibility

#### Applying and innovating

- Contribute to care for self, others, community, and world through individual or collaborative approaches
- Co-operatively design projects with local and/or global connections and applications
- Contribute to finding solutions to problems at a local and/or global level through inquiry
- Implement multiple strategies to solve problems in real-life, applied, and conceptual situations
- Consider the role of scientists in innovation

#### Communicating

- Formulate physical or mental theoretical models to describe a phenomenon
- Communicate scientific ideas and information, and perhaps a suggested course of action, for a specific purpose and audience, constructing evidence-based arguments and using appropriate scientific language, conventions, and representations
- Express and reflect on a variety of experiences, perspectives, and worldviews through place
