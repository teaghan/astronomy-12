## Unit 5: Galaxies and the Universe

This unit takes students on an expansive journey through the cosmos, exploring the large-scale structure of the universe, the diverse types of galaxies, the mysteries of black holes, and the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Students will uncover how galaxies form and evolve, understand the dynamic processes within black holes, and learn about the possible futures of the universe driven by dark matter and dark energy.

### Self-Assessment
- Each section of this unit includes a set of "Check Your Understanding" questions that are designed to prepare you for the midterm exam.

### [5.1 The Big Bang and the Early Universe](https://github.com/teaghan/astronomy-12/tree/main/Unit5/5_1_early_universe.ipynb)
- **The Big Bang Theory**: Learn about the evidence supporting the Big Bang, including cosmic microwave background radiation and nucleosynthesis.
- **The Early Universe**: Understand the first few moments after the Big Bang and the formation of the first atomic nuclei.

### [5.2 Cosmology](https://github.com/teaghan/astronomy-12/tree/main/Unit5/5_2_cosmology.ipynb)
- **Structure of the Universe**: Explore the organization of matter into galaxies, clusters, and superclusters.
- **Hubble’s Law**: Understand how redshift reveals the expansion of the universe and the relationship between distance and velocity for galaxies.
- **The Cosmological Principle**: Learn about the homogeneous and isotropic nature of the universe on large scales.
- **Hubble’s Constant**: Examine the significance of Hubble’s constant and current efforts to refine its value.

### [5.3 Types of Galaxies](https://github.com/teaghan/astronomy-12/tree/main/Unit5/5_3_types_of_galaxies.ipynb)
