## Unit 5: Stars and Stellar Evolution

This unit focuses on the life cycle of stars, from their formation in nebulae to their ultimate fate as white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. It includes the classification of stars and the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.

### 5.1 Star Formation
- Role of nebulae and interstellar medium.
- Process of nuclear fusion initiation.

### 5.2 Stellar Classification
- Spectral types and luminosity classes.
- Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.

### 5.3 Stellar Evolution
- Life cycle of low, medium, and high-mass stars.
- Supernovae, neutron stars, and black holes.

### 5.4 The Structure of the Atom
- Basic atomic structure and its relation to nuclear fusion.

### 5.5 The Doppler Effect in Astronomy
- Practical applications in measuring stellar motions.
