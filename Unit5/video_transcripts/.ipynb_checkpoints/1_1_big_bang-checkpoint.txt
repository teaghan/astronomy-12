It’s Professor Dave, let’s talk about cosmology.
0:09
While astrophysics is the field of science that studies the universe and everything in
0:14
it, the subfield of astrophysics that specifically studies the origin and development of the
0:20
universe is called cosmology.
0:23
That means that if we are going to start our story from the beginning, we have to start
0:28
with cosmology.
0:30
How did the universe begin, and when?
0:32
Early civilizations had all kinds of mythology surrounding this question.
0:36
But ever since the 20th century, we have begun to answer it not with stories, but with science.
0:43
Actual empirical evidence that provides clues as to how it all began.
0:48
And what does this evidence tell us?
0:50
Overwhelmingly, it tells us that the universe was born around 13.8 billion years ago, from
0:57
a single point.
0:59
Scientists and laypeople alike refer to this event, the beginning of our universe, as The
1:05
Big Bang, a name coined by astrophysicist Fred Hoyle in an attempt to criticize the
1:11
model, but ironically it stuck.
1:14
Many people are incredulous of such a big bang, considering the whole idea to be completely absurd.
1:20
But the main reason for this is nothing more than a cosmic gap in understanding of principles
1:26
in physics and astronomy.
1:29
When most people imagine the Big Bang, they think of a loud kaboom, a cartoon explosion
1:35
graphic, and the present-day, fully-formed universe spilling out of it, with a comet,
1:40
and the planet Saturn, and other complex objects.
1:43
This would indeed be impossible to believe, and in fact, it could not be further from
1:48
the truth.
1:49
In this tutorial we will describe, in a basic way, our current model for the birth and early
1:55
development of the universe, as understood by modern cosmologists.
1:59
Unfortunately, we will not yet be ready to discuss the evidence that supports this model,
2:05
because understanding that evidence will require a discussion of galaxies and many other objects
2:11
that we will get to later in the series.
2:14
So for now, try to simply take this model at face value, and I promise that later on,
2:19
we will examine several independent threads of evidence that all corroborate this model
2:25
of origin and specific age for the universe to great precision.
2:31
So now, let’s start at the beginning.
2:33
To be fair, at present, we don’t know what happened at the beginning.
2:37
By the beginning, we mean t equals zero.
2:39
The first instant.
2:42
Our understanding begins to take shape at around 10 to the negative 36 seconds after
2:47
the big bang.
2:48
That’s a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second.
2:52
From that moment forward, we start to have an increasingly solid grasp of how things
2:57
must have gone, which is pretty darn impressive when you think about it.
3:01
As for the imperceivably small increment of time before that, we must admit that our current
3:07
models just don’t work.
3:08
We will still talk about this earliest period here, but to be clear, it will be largely
3:13
speculative, including some of my own personal conjecture.
3:16
But don’t worry, we will quickly get back to the real science.
3:54
I’m already exhausted.
3:57
Let’s just start at the first moment, and picture blackness, since that’s kind of
4:00
the best we can do.
4:02
Now, the first thing, time zero.
4:05
Freeze the clock.
4:07
A single point.
4:08
The uncaused cause.
4:10
How could this have happened?
4:11
Let’s first recall some things about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.
4:15
This tells us that when looking at complementary variables, like energy and time, the more
4:20
certainty associated with one, the less certainty that can be associated with the other.
4:25
This is what allows for quantum fluctuation, the very real and very measurable phenomenon
4:31
by which particles pop into and out of existence, all over the universe and at all times.
4:37
This means that the idea that something could simply appear is actually not without precedent.
4:42
Of course, to go from virtual particles to the entire universe is quite a leap, for a
4:46
number of reasons, but if you really think about it, with nothing else in existence yet
4:52
to be compared to, would this fluctuation have been large or small?
4:56
Is it a lot of energy or a little?
4:58
In comparison to what, precisely?
5:01
What if, taking into account both positive and negative energy, the net energy is very
5:06
close to zero?
5:07
Then the entire universe could be regarded as a quantum fluctuation, borrowing energy
5:14
it will pay back later.
5:16
If we take for granted that without any other frame of reference, a quantitative amount
5:20
of energy appearing from nothing can be of any arbitrary amount, then we are acknowledging
5:26
that the appearance of some energy from no energy is the only thing we must explain.
5:32
It is the emergence of an initial duality.
5:35
Plus and minus.
5:36
Yes and no.
5:37
Whatever you want to call it.
5:39
It is not planets and stars tumbling out of a kablooey graphic.
5:43
It is the emergence of the simplest possible thing that is a thing, rather than no-thing.
5:50
Everything else follows from there.
5:53
Now we get to 10 to the negative 43 seconds after the big bang.
5:56
What do we know about this time?
5:59
Still not much.
6:00
But if we recall some things about the standard model of particle physics, experiments in
6:05
particle accelerators have allowed us to begin the incredible task of unifying the four fundamental forces.
6:12
These are the electromagnetic force, the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, and gravity.
6:19
In that earliest period that we know almost nothing about, also called the Planck epoch,
6:25
given the universe’s minuscule size, the temperature of the universe must have been
6:30
over 10 to the 32 Kelvin, which is nearly a billion trillion trillion degrees, far too
6:37
hot for familiar particles to exist, and all four forces must have been unified into one
6:43
single force.
6:44
The search for quantum gravity is the search for the quantum particle that would mediate
6:49
this singular force, thus it is sometimes called the search for the theory of everything.
6:54
Particle accelerators can’t yet achieve this incredible energy, so we must hope for
6:58
bigger and better technology.
7:00
But in the next epoch, from 10 to the negative 43 seconds until 10 to the negative 36 seconds,
7:06
also called the grand unification epoch, temperatures cooled down to 10 to the 29 Kelvin.
7:14
This allowed for gravity to decouple from the other three forces, which can be collectively
7:19
referred to as the electrostrong force, and which we believe could potentially be described
7:25
by a grand unified theory.
7:28
This act of forces breaking off from other forces is the result of symmetry breaking,
7:34
a phenomenon that can occur when extreme temperatures cool below certain transition temperatures.
7:42
In this way, we can understand that all the disparate fundamental particles in the universe
7:47
were once part of the same thing, that only manifested as different objects as a result
7:54
of a series of successive symmetry breakings while the universe cooled.
8:00
Next, we enter the earliest era for which theoretical physics has some reasonable basis,
8:07
taking place from 10 to the negative 36 seconds until 10 to the negative 32 seconds after
8:13
the Big Bang.
8:14
This is called the electroweak epoch.
8:17
It is marked by the decoupling of the strong nuclear force from the electrostrong force,
8:23
leaving only the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces together, which we call the
8:29
electroweak force.
8:31
This is possible now with the universe having cooled to a frosty 10 to the 28 Kelvin.
8:37
Roughly concurrent with the electroweak epoch is what we call the inflationary epoch.
8:44
This was a brief period in which the universe expanded by an incredible factor, around 26
8:51
orders of magnitude, triggered by the separation of the elecrostrong force into the strong
8:56
nuclear force and electroweak force.
9:00
We don’t know the precise size of the universe before and after this phase, but the magnitude
9:05
of the expansion would be like inflating something the size of a small molecule up to something
9:11
ten light years across, or about 60 trillion miles.
9:17
This nearly instantaneous expansion dispersed the earliest fundamental particles around
9:23
this much larger volume quite evenly, after which the immense potential energy from the
9:29
inflation was released, producing a hot plasma of quarks, anti-quarks, and gluons.
9:37
Plodding along to around 10 to the negative 12 seconds, or one trillionth of a second
9:43
after the Big Bang, we enter a period called the quark epoch.
9:48
Here, things have cooled enough for the third and final symmetry to break, decoupling the
9:53
electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces, thus resulting in the four distinct forces we know today.
10:01
As a result, the Higgs field bestows existing particles with mass for the first time, but
10:07
things are still too hot for protons and neutrons to form.
10:11
This is also the highest-energy epoch that we can currently probe with particle accelerators,
10:16
which means we are now transitioning from theoretical cosmology to experimental.
10:23
At around 10 to the negative 6 seconds after the Big Bang, things finally cool down enough
10:28
for the quark-gluon plasma that permeates the universe to congeal into hadrons, which
10:35
are particles made of quarks.
10:38
This includes baryons like protons and neutrons, which will eventually make up all the atoms
10:43
in the universe.
10:45
This is called the hadron epoch, lasting until one full second after the Big Bang.
10:52
The action will slow down a bit from here, but before we move on, take a moment to imagine
10:57
how much has happened in just one second, the void yielding merely some energy and a
11:04
singular force, which sequentially breaks into four forces, in turn yielding a sea of
11:11
massive particles.
11:13
From one second to ten seconds after the big bang lasted the lepton epoch.
11:18
Hadrons and antihadrons largely annihilate leaving leptons and anti-leptons to dominate,
11:25
which in turn also largely annihilate, and thanks to a slight asymmetry in favor of matter
11:31
over antimatter, this leaves just a fraction of the original matter behind.
11:37
From here, the start of the photon epoch, things start to look a little more familiar.
11:43
For about seventeen minutes, the universe is cool enough for baryons to be stable, but
11:50
also hot enough for them to fuse, so protons and neutrons fuse together to make lots of
11:56
hydrogen and helium, and trace amounts of other light nuclei, an era called big bang
12:03
nucleosynthesis.
12:05
After that, it gets too cold and sparse, so fusion halts, locking the universe into a
12:11
three-to-one ratio of hydrogen to helium by mass.
12:15
At this point, the universe is about 600 light years across, so we are no longer dealing
12:21
with a tiny universe.
12:24
Over the next several hundred thousand years, as the universe continues to expand, all of
12:29
these hydrogen and helium nuclei begin to collect in little patches, due to the effects
12:35
of gravity.
12:37
This force, now understood through Einstein’s general relativity to be the warping of spacetime
12:43
by massive objects, attracts all objects with mass towards one another.
12:50
So by virtue of the mass of these nuclei, and more so, all the dark matter around the
12:55
universe, which we will discuss later, the universe takes on a sinewy, filament-like structure.
13:02
Denser regions become more dense, and empty regions become more empty, as the photon epoch
13:08
draws to a close.
13:11
During the next era, recombination and photon decoupling, about 377 thousand years after
13:18
the big bang, things are finally cool enough for electrons to combine with nuclei to form
13:25
neutral atoms for the first time.
13:28
Electrons are captured, relax down to the ground state, and emit photons in doing so.
13:34
This marks the first time that the universe is actually visible, in the sense that we
13:39
consider something to be visible to our eyes.
13:42
It is no longer opaque, but transparent, with electromagnetic radiation now moving freely
13:49
over large distances, and with a diameter for the universe of nearly 100 million light
13:55
years, the distances are large indeed.
14:00
Then for around 150 million years, not much happened.
14:03
We call this era the dark ages.
14:06
There was plenty of hydrogen and helium around, and photons were traveling everywhere, but
14:11
there were no stars to produce all the light we see in the night sky today.
14:16
Things continued to cool, from around 4,000 Kelvin, down to 300 Kelvin, which incredibly
14:23
would allow for liquid water, if any were to exist, all the way to around 60 Kelvin,
14:29
a temperature that is finally cold enough by human standards to somewhat resemble the
14:34
cold outer space we normally conceive of.
14:37
But slowly, ever so slowly, all the clouds of hydrogen and helium gas continue to collect.
14:45
Over millions of years the minute gravity exerted by these particles, combined with
14:50
the more significant gravity exerted by surrounding dark matter, pulled matter together into clumps,
14:58
little dense pockets of matter.
15:01
Closer and closer, until all the atoms are pushing right up against one another.
15:06
What happens when you get enough atoms all together in the same place?
15:12
Ignition.
15:13
So let’s move forward and see what happened next
