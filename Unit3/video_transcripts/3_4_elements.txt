welcome back to universio
0:03
today the origin of elements
0:06
elements are the basic building block of
0:08
matter
0:09
the stuff around us is all made up of
0:12
elements
0:13
basic elements can be combined to form
0:15
compounds but they cannot themselves be
0:17
manufactured out of something else
0:20
so the question is where did these
0:22
elements come from
0:25
the Big Bang created our universe 13.7
0:28
billion years ago
0:30
it basically just created hydrogen and a
0:32
little bit of helium
0:34
we basically only had the first two
0:36
elements of the periodic table
0:40
the universe kept expanding after the
0:42
big bang but gravity was causing
0:44
hydrogen particles to come together
0:46
they moved faster and faster under the
0:49
influence of gravity
0:50
the faster they travel the more energy
0:52
they gained and the hotter they became
0:55
as the temperature increased hydrogen
0:58
became a plasma which formed the first
1:00
star
1:01
nuclear fusion took place in the core of
1:04
the star where temperatures and
1:06
pressures are high enough to initiate
1:07
the process
1:09
the process started with hydrogen's
1:11
atoms
1:12
their electrons got enough energy that
1:14
they could escape from the atoms which
1:16
left protons behind
1:18
some of the protons could turn into
1:20
neutrons with the help of the weak Force
1:22
by various processes two protons and two
1:25
neutrons eventually form the nucleus of
1:28
a helium element
1:30
normally it would not be possible for
1:32
two protons and two neutrons to come
1:34
together to form a helium nucleus
1:36
because the two protons would repel one
1:39
another
1:40
but the core of stars was so hot and
1:42
particles therefore have sufficient
1:44
energy that they can overcome the
1:45
coulomb repulsion force and fuse
1:47
together
1:49
the process of converting hydrogen into
1:51
helium releases energy
1:53
this is because the mass of two protons
1:55
and two neutrons is slightly greater
1:57
than the mass of the helium nucleus
2:00
the mass difference is converted into
2:02
energy by Einstein's famous formula
2:05
the released energy creates a pressure
2:07
which is sufficient to balance the
2:09
gravitational forces
2:10
while the nuclear fusion process is
2:13
working gravity is held and the star
2:15
maintains its size
2:17
this is what happens for pretty much the
2:19
entire duration of their life
2:22
for example our own sun is 5 billion
2:25
years old
2:26
it still has another 5 billion years to
2:28
go
2:29
throughout that time it is steadily
2:32
converting hydrogen into helium
2:35
at some point all the hydrogen in the
2:37
core of a star has been converted into
2:39
helium
2:40
the outer layers may still contain a
2:42
substantial amount of hydrogen but the
2:44
main Fusion process will stop
2:46
once the fusion process in the core has
2:49
stopped gravity takes over again and the
2:51
star begins to contract
2:53
as it does so its temperature increases
2:56
even further and now the helium in the
2:58
core has sufficient energy to fuse which
3:01
makes higher elements in the periodic
3:02
table
3:03
depending how big and how hot the star
3:06
is the fusion process is capable of
3:08
manufacturing Elements by Fusion all the
3:10
way up to iron which has 26 protons in
3:13
its nucleus
3:15
once stars have got to a point where
3:17
their core is made of iron the fusion
3:19
process stops
3:21
gravity once again dominates
3:23
the star quickly begins to collapse
3:26
what happens next
3:28
now it depends on the size of the star
3:32
for small Stars the gravitational
3:34
collapse will be stopped by a process
3:36
called poly Exclusion Principle
3:38
two electrons cannot occupy the same
3:40
energy State at the same time
3:43
that resistance by electrons to being in
3:45
the same state is sufficient to stop
3:47
Gravity from causing any further
3:49
collapse of the star
3:51
the fusion process has ended and the
3:53
star will continue to Glow for many
3:55
billions of years known as a white dwarf
3:58
eventually it will cool down and fade
4:00
from View
4:02
but for bigger Stars gravity is
4:04
sufficient to overcome the effects of
4:06
the poly Exclusion Principle
4:08
the star's outer surfaces are collapsing
4:10
onto a hugely energetic inner core
4:13
this results in a cataclysmic explosion
4:15
of astronomical proportions known as a
4:18
supernova
4:19
in a few days more energy is released
4:22
from that star than from a whole galaxy
4:24
it is during this period that elements
4:26
all the way up to uranium can be
4:28
manufactured
4:30
the core of the star continues to
4:32
contract under the forces of gravity
4:34
atoms in the star are crushed
4:37
electrons and protons are forced
4:39
together to make neutrons
4:41
the neutrons are then squashed together
4:44
the star becomes a neutron star
4:47
the star is probably only the size of a
4:49
city and it rotates very quickly one
4:52
teaspoon full of the material on a
4:54
neutron star would weigh 500 million
4:56
tons
4:58
at this point a different version of the
5:00
poly Exclusion Principle comes into play
5:03
this stops two neutrons from being in
5:05
the same state
5:06
that will stop the gravitational
5:08
collapse unless the star is so massive
5:10
that gravity can even overcome this one
5:13
last barrier
5:14
if it does so there is no known physics
5:17
that can stop the star from continually
5:19
Contracting becoming ever more dense
5:21
until it becomes a black hole
5:23
a black hole is known as a singularity
5:26
because it has no spatial dimensions
5:28
the entire mass of a star is condensed
5:31
into a space which is infinitesimally
5:33
small
5:35
but what about the remnants of the
5:36
Supernova that have been exploded into
5:38
space
5:39
gravity takes over again and begins to
5:42
draw them together until they form the
5:43
basis of another star and the whole
5:45
process can start all over again
