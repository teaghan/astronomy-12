you should understand that temperature
0:04
and heat are not the same thing
0:07
temperature is a measure of how fast the
0:10
atoms of a material are moving heat is a
0:13
measure of energy output and of course
0:16
heat always flows from a region of
0:18
higher temperature to lower temperature
0:21
these are Concepts you should hopefully
0:23
recall from your study of
0:25
physics well now's the time where you're
0:28
going to see some amazing application of
0:31
these VAR Concepts let's take this step
0:34
by step starting with an
0:37
analogy which has a higher temperature a
0:41
campfire or a warm compost heap indeed
0:45
the campfire which is to say the average
0:47
speed of the atoms in the campfire is
0:50
much faster that's why you wouldn't want
0:52
to put your finger in the
0:54
campfire but the campfire and the
0:57
compost heap are both releasing energy
0:59
energy to the environment right the
1:02
campfire releases it real quickly
1:05
because of its higher temperature and
1:07
the compost he releases energy much more
1:10
slowly because of its lower temperature
1:13
got
1:14
that now what if the compost heap were
1:18
much
1:19
bigger say it has the very same
1:21
temperature but it's much much bigger
1:24
like the size of many city
1:27
blocks because it's bigger do see that
1:30
the total amount of energy it releases
1:32
each second is also much bigger any bit
1:36
of the compost tap might not be that
1:39
much but add it all together and wow
1:42
that's a lot of
1:44
energy so let me ask you which releases
1:47
more energy the small campfire or this
1:50
humongous compost heap sure the campfire
1:54
has a higher temperature but it's quite
1:57
small by
1:58
comparison so you see this lower
2:00
temperature compost heap puts out much
2:03
more total energy than the higher
2:05
temperature
2:07
campfire temperature and heat are not
2:10
the same
2:11
thing if you understand this you'll
2:14
understand the same thing happening with
2:17
stars the star prion has a toasty
2:20
surface temperature of about 6,500
2:22
Kelvin remember we get the surface
2:25
temperature from the star's color its
2:27
Luminosity is a mere 6
2:30
n oh and remember from the last lesson
2:33
that Luminosity is a measure of a star's
2:35
energy output relative to our own Sun so
2:38
pran is 6.9 times more luminous than our
2:42
sun okay the star Bal juice has a
2:46
surface temperature of about 3,000
2:48
Kelvin so because it's cooler you might
2:51
expect its Luminosity to be less than
2:54
6.9 huh well that might be true if they
2:58
were the same size as shown here here
3:01
but that cool to the touch Bal juice has
3:04
a Luminosity of about
3:07
120,000 huh how can something this cool
3:10
put out so much energy think of the
3:14
compost
3:15
heap your conclusion yeah they obviously
3:20
cannot be the same size that Bal juice
3:23
puts out so much energy and is yet
3:25
cooler tells us that Bal juice must be
3:28
much larger
3:30
a Luminosity of
3:33
120,000 Bal juice must be extremely
3:36
large indeed the calculations made by
3:39
astronomers show Bal juice to be
3:41
astoundingly large the point here is
3:45
that by comparing the Luminosity of a
3:47
star to its surface temperature we gain
3:49
a measure of that star's size now that's
3:54
crafty because it means we don't have to
3:57
actually travel to a star in order to
3:59
measure how big it
4:01
is it also allows us to study and
4:03
compare stars to each
4:06
other in doing this we can get a sense
4:08
of all the different kinds of stars
4:11
there
4:12
are this in turn allows us to reveal the
4:15
potential histories and life cycles of
4:20
stars the graph that correlates Stellar
4:23
Luminosity to temperature is called the
4:25
Herz sprung Russell diagram or the HR
4:28
diagram for
4:30
short it's a rather important diagram in
4:34
many ways what the periodic table is to
4:37
chemistry the HR diagram is to
4:40
astronomy as a chemist myself I like to
4:43
call it the Periodic Table of
4:45
astronomy of course don't memorize this
4:49
thing rather let's learn how to read it
4:53
luminous stars are at the top and dim
4:55
Stars toward the bottom note that
4:58
Luminosity is given in
5:01
exponents so for example when you go
5:03
from here to here the Luminosity is 10
5:06
times as great from here to here you're
5:09
talking about a hundredfold increase in
5:14
Luminosity on the horizontal axis the
5:17
higher surface temperatures are shown to
5:19
the left anything about 10,000 Kelvin or
5:23
greater is indicated as a bluish star
5:26
anything cooler than 4,000 Kelvin is
5:29
shown as a reddish
5:31
star most stars fall within a diagonal
5:35
line which we call the main sequence our
5:38
sun is an example of a main sequence
5:41
star all these stars are burning
5:43
primarily hydrogen as their nuclear
5:46
fuel above the main sequence are the
5:49
Giants Super Giants and even the hyper
5:52
Giants here Arcturus is an example of a
5:55
giant Bal juu is a super giant well
5:59
maybe a hyper giant it's subjective but
6:03
VY Kennis Majoris now that would
6:05
definitely be a hyper giant the HR
6:09
diagram plots Luminosity using exponents
6:12
it it has to otherwise the range of
6:14
luminosities wouldn't fit on a regular
6:17
siiz piece of paper likewise it's not
6:20
very practical depicting the relative
6:22
sizes of stars on a regular piece of
6:24
paper so HR diagrams when printed on
6:28
regular paper are limited in their
6:31
ability to give us the sense of star
6:33
sizes but here in video we don't have
6:37
that limitation nice
6:40
eh oh we should talk about densities get
6:44
this as large as Bal juice is it's only
6:46
about 15 times more massive than our sun
6:50
so while it's huge it's only huge at the
6:54
expense of not being very
6:56
dense its outer Photosphere for example
6:59
is less dense than the air you're
7:01
breathing right now that's billions of
7:03
times less dense than our much smaller
7:06
but much more compact
7:08
Sun speaking of compact below the main
7:11
sequence we have stars that are
7:13
necessarily tiny this includes the white
7:17
dwarfs we'll be talking about white
7:19
dwarfs in more detail in a bit briefly
7:23
our sun is destined to become a white
7:25
dwarf when that happens it'll have a
7:28
density that's out the roof like a
7:31
million times that of
7:33
gold oh what's the difference between a
7:36
blue super giant and a red super
7:38
giant well one has a higher temperature
7:42
right
7:44
which good but why might the blue super
7:48
giant have a higher
7:50
temperature oh it must be cranking out
7:54
more thermonuclear Fusion so which do
7:57
you suppose would be more dense a blue
8:00
super giant or a red super
8:03
giant if you're going to have more
8:06
thermonuclear Fusion you're going to
8:08
need a good concentration of fuel right
8:11
so the blue one hey excellent H you
8:16
might even be in a position now to
8:18
answer why it is that the average blue
8:21
super giant is smaller than the average
8:23
red super
8:25
giant how nice if you could talk about
8:28
these and other questions with
8:30
classmates or better yet with classmates
8:33
and your course instructor Al together
8:35
in the
8:37
classroom don't think that you're going
8:39
to have command over these Concepts just
8:41
by watching these videos over and over
8:43
again no you need to try articulating
8:46
these Concepts
8:48
yourself if you want entertainment just
8:50
sit back relax and watch like you might
8:53
do at some sporting event that's not bad
8:57
we all appreciate good entertainment
9:00
all I'm saying is if you want to be a
9:02
player you got to play if you want to do
9:06
well on your exams you got to do more
9:08
than just watch you got to interact you
9:11
got to get your mouth
9:13
moving are we
9:16
interacting no I'm just lecturing to you
9:19
and you're
9:21
listening that's not good
9:26
enough well that's your basic
9:29
introduction to the herzsprung Russell
9:31
diagram in the next lesson we're going
9:34
to use this diagram to explore the
9:36
various potential life cycles of stars
9:39
fascinating stuff till
9:42
then good science to
9:45
