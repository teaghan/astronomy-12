The Sun was always a bit of a mystery.
0:04
No one could figure out what was powering it.
0:08
In the 19th century, some scientists thought it could all be explained by gravity.
0:14
The Sun began as a giant cloud of dust and gas.
0:18
And this cloud collapsed under the force of gravity releasing lots of heat.
0:25
This might explain why the Sun is hot, but it doesn't explain why the Sun has been hot
0:31
for so long.
0:33
A clear picture didn't emerge until we had a better model of the atom.
0:39
At the center of each atom is a tiny nucleus made of protons and neutrons.
0:45
Protons have a positive electric charge and this is a problem because their charges are
0:51
pushing them apart.
0:53
The electric force is trying to rip apart the nucleus.
0:58
But there is a strong force holding it together: the nuclear force.
1:05
The nuclear force bring protons and neutrons together.
1:09
It doesn't really affect pairs of protons or pairs of neutrons.
1:14
To hold everything together you need to have just the right combination of protons and
1:19
neutrons.
1:21
Too many protons and it falls apart.
1:23
Too many neutrons and it falls apart.
1:26
But when you get just the right combination, you produce a nuclear reaction.
1:33
Nuclear reactions are similar to chemical reactions in many ways.
1:37
There are certain combinations of chemicals that are more stable.When you form stable
1:43
compounds, you make energy.
1:46
For example, if you combine hydrogen and oxygen to make H20, this is a more stable combination
1:53
and you make energy.
1:55
Similarly, if you combine two hydrogen nuclei into Helium, this is a more stable combination
2:02
and you make energy.
2:05
But nuclear reactions are different from chemical reactions.
2:08
They're much harder to produce, they're much more powerful, and they involve neutrons.
2:15
Chemical reactions are part of our everyday life, but nuclear reactions are not.The reason
2:22
is that the nuclear force only works over very short distances.
2:27
The protons are all positively charged.
2:30
So if you bring hydrogen nuclei together, they just repel each other.
2:35
If you bring them closer, they repel each other more.
2:38
The nuclear force only kicks in when they are extremely close.
2:44
Normally, the nuclei never get near each other.
2:48
It is only under conditions of extreme pressure and extreme heat that the nuclei will collide.
2:56
And this only happens at the center of a very massive object like our Sun or inside a nuclear
3:03
bomb.
3:06
Neutrons are very important in nuclear reactions, but for chemical reactions they're irrelevant.
3:13
This is a hydrogen nucleus and so is this.
3:16
For the purposes of chemistry, we don't care about the neutrons.
3:21
But for nuclear reactions, we do.
3:23
We have to keep track of them.
3:25
So this is a Hydrogen-1 nucleus.
3:28
And this is a Hydrogen-2 nucleus.
3:31
The number at the end is the total number of protons and neutrons.
3:35
Two protons and a neutron make Helium-3.
3:38
Two and two makes Helium-4.
3:42
Hydrogen-2 is also know as Deuterium.
3:46
Nuclear reactions are very powerful.
3:50
Let's look at our two reactions again.
3:52
The chemical reactions releases 5 eV of energy.
3:56
The nuclear reaction releases 24 million eV of energy.
4:01
So the nuclear reaction is 5 million times more powerful.
4:07
There's enough energy in just a pound of deuterium to power 10,000 homes for a year.
4:12
This is an insane amount of energy.
4:15
It's why the Sun is so bright, why nuclear bombs are so scary, and why scientists have
4:21
been working on fusion power for decades with little success.
4:26
There's another nuclear force that we need to talk about.
4:29
We've been talking about the strong nuclear force, but there's also a weak nuclear force.
4:36
The strong force is what holds the nucleus together.
4:39
The weak force causes radioactivity.
4:43
And it's called the weak force because it acts slowly.
4:47
The weak force can cause protons and neutrons to switch identities.
4:52
A proton can turn into a neutron.
4:55
Or a neutron can turn into a proton.
4:58
This is called beta decay.
5:01
Neutrons are heavier than protons just barely.
5:04
But what this means is that a free neutron can lose some mass and turn into a proton.
5:11
But a proton cannot turn into a neutron unless it's near other particles.
5:17
The reason this process is called beta decay is because it's one of the ways that a radioactive
5:23
element can decay.
5:25
Now it turns out that radioactivity can be slow.
5:29
Imagine you have a box full of Uranium-235 atoms.
5:33
Eventually, the Uranium atoms will all turn into Lead, but they're not in any hurry to
5:39
do this.
5:41
If you want to wait until half your Uranium atoms have turn into Lead, you'll be waiting
5:46
700 million years.
5:51
Radioactivity involves more than just beta decay.
5:54
There's actually more going on here.
5:56
But the point is that beta decay can be a slow process and it's a random process.
6:03
Now we finally have covered enough background to explain how the Sun shines.
6:09
This was worked out in the 30s by Hans Bethe.
6:13
The Sun is mostly made of Hydrogen-1 which is just a proton.
6:18
The Sun is very hot and very dense so these protons collide.
6:23
But this doesn't cause a nuclear reaction because there's no neutrons.
6:28
Most of the time when two protons collide they immediately fly apart producing no energy.
6:35
But it is possible, very very rarely, that something else happens: beta decay.
6:43
At the moment the two protons collide, one of them undergoes beta decay and turns into
6:49
a neutron.
6:51
This gives us Hydrogen-2 and releases tons of energy.
6:55
The Hydrogen-2 nucleus continues moving around and when it bumps into a proton it turns into
7:02
Helium-3 and this releases tons of energy..
7:08
As this process continues, the Sun produces more and more Helium-3.
7:13
When two Helium-3 nuclei collide, they can form into an even better combination Helium-4
7:20
and this releases tons of energy.
7:23
Hydrogen is converted into Helium in three steps.
7:27
First, two protons are combined into Deuterium through beta decay.
7:32
Next a proton is added to make Helium-3 and finally two Helium-3 nuclei collide creating
7:39
Helium-4 plus two leftover protons.
7:43
The first step is by far the slowest because you have to wait for beta decay.
7:48
For a typical proton in the center of the Sun the first step takes on average one billion
7:54
years.
7:56
Compare that to the second step which takes about 4 seconds.
7:59
Now in the final step, you have to find another Helium nucleus which is rare.
8:03
This takes about 400 years.These nuclear reactions are the source of the Sun's tremendous power.
8:12
The Sun is the ultimate energy source.
8:15
The Sun heats the air which causes wind.
8:18
The Sun heats water which causes rain giving us hydroelectric power.
8:25
Sunlight is the foundation of life.
8:27
The energy from ancient sunlight was deposited into the ground giving us our fossil fuels:
8:33
coal, oil, and natural gas.
8:36
Practically all the world's energy ultimately comes from either the Sun or nuclear power.
8:42
To summarize, we present: Children Explaining Nuclear Physics.
8:47
Hydrogen-1 atoms.
8:50
The Sun is made up most of these.
8:54
Now what if two of them collide?
8:58
Then one of them will turn into a neutron and you get Hydrogen-2.
9:07
Next, it collides with another atom becomes Helium-3.
9:12
And then it collides with another one and you get Helium-4.
9:18
