Intro
0:02
the story of the formation of stars is
0:05
something that astronomers have been
0:06
trying to piece together for quite some
0:08
time and this is largely because the
0:11
stars themselves are shrouded in secrecy
0:13
I mean literally and shrouded in secrecy
0:17
we know for example that stars are
0:19
points of light and they are composed of
0:23
hydrogen and helium gas however when we
0:26
look around the night sky we see mostly
0:28
the points of light we seldom see the
0:31
gas itself well that's because the gas
0:33
is quite cool if you look at the
0:36
constellation of Orion you'll see
0:38
there's a relatively small patch of that
0:41
gas that is glowing kind of like a
0:43
fluorescent lamp but if we could look
0:46
into the same region with infrared eyes
0:49
we would see all of that cool gas known
0:53
as the Orion molecular cloud let's take
0:57
a closer look however at the Orion
0:59
Nebula let's take a closer look at the
1:02
near-infrared so you can see those very
1:04
hot bright stars at the center the--
1:07
these stars are called the trapezium and
1:10
surrounding the trapezium are these
1:13
tinier red little points of light
1:16
well these points of light look like
1:18
stars but they're not quite stars just
1:20
yet they are in fact proto stars so
1:23
proto stars are really just the cores of
1:25
collapsing molecular clouds we have
1:28
clouds within the clouds within the
1:30
clouds and tiny clumps form and they
1:32
collapse as they collapse they heat up
1:35
so they release a great deal of infrared
1:38
radiation now the cores themselves are
1:40
hot but they're not yet hot enough to
1:43
cause hydrogen to fuse into helium
1:46
through thermonuclear fusion and this is
1:49
just because the temperatures and the
1:50
pressures are building but they haven't
1:52
yet reached that critical mass or that
1:55
critical pressure to trigger hydrogen
1:58
fusion so let's take a look at the broad
Formation cycle
2:01
steps of star formation we initially
2:04
begin with a cloud and the cloud is
2:07
consisting of moving molecules of gas so
2:10
that means that there's a pressure in
2:12
the cloud and despite the
2:13
fact that the cloud has some mass to it
2:16
rather than just collapsing under its
2:18
own gravity it's kind of repelled from
2:20
doing that by virtue of the motions of
2:23
the particles themselves
2:24
so pressure overcomes its mutual gravity
2:28
but something happens something triggers
2:32
the formation of little clumps of gas
2:36
and dust somewhere in the middle of
2:38
these clouds now these dense clumps have
2:41
mass and therefore they have gravity now
2:44
gravity starts to overtake the pressure
2:46
right it starts to overtake the motions
2:49
of the molecules and so as clumps form
2:53
then little cores form inside the clumps
2:56
these cores are essentially the
2:59
protostars they gain mass and therefore
3:01
the gravitational pull of these cores
3:04
increases so there now becomes a bit of
3:07
a snowball effect and this has effect of
3:09
accelerating the collapse but as the
3:12
cloud collapses it's rotating and this
3:16
causes the disc to flatten out so now
3:19
we've formed what's called a
3:20
circumstellar disk and we can think of
3:23
the disk as an inner disc which directly
3:26
feeds the protostar so this sometimes is
3:28
called an accretion disk or also called
3:31
a proto stellar disk and the remaining
3:34
outer disk flattens eventually and
3:36
becomes what's called a proto planetary
3:39
disk so eventually we would expect
3:41
planets to form inside this disk and at
3:45
some point the star itself the protostar
3:48
turns on in other words the pressures
3:51
and the temperatures are now high enough
3:53
that suddenly we can have thermonuclear
3:55
fusion in the core and this produces
3:58
tremendous fast winds that's helped
4:02
sweep out the disk as well as the
4:04
planets themselves they collect all the
4:06
debris in their path and the planetary
4:09
system is now born the star is a proper
4:15
planetary system so a main driver of the
4:18
story is the fact that the entire cloud
4:21
and subsequent disk and the stars
4:23
themselves are all rotating and
4:26
whenever we think of something that's
4:28
rotating it's important to consider a
Angular momentum, L
4:30
quantity called angular momentum all
4:33
objects in motion have momentum and if
4:35
the object is rotating we call that
4:38
rotational momentum or more properly
4:40
angular momentum and angular momentum
4:44
depends on three things it's a product
4:47
of the mass of the rotating body the
4:50
rotational velocity or the angular
4:53
velocity the rate at which it's rotating
4:55
and also how spread out the masses
4:59
now angular momentum has a certain
5:01
property and namely that it's a
5:03
conserved quantity in other words it's
5:06
always going to remain constant even if
5:09
we were to somehow change one of the
5:11
three parameters so when a figure skater
5:14
is spinning if she has her arms spread
5:16
out she rotates relatively slowly but as
5:18
she brings her arms in she rotates
5:21
faster this is how the angular momentum
5:24
is conserved her mass doesn't change so
5:27
what has a change it's her rotational
5:29
velocity so what does this have to do
5:32
with stars again well remember stars are
5:34
forming out of these giant molecular
5:36
clouds and there are thousands of them
5:39
spread out just within our galaxy alone
5:41
each of these molecular clouds has the
5:45
mass of anywhere from a couple thousand
5:47
to up to a million Suns and they are
5:51
spread out over hundreds to thousands of
5:54
light year so even though these clouds
5:57
are rotating very slowly each of them
5:59
contain a tremendous amount of angular
6:02
momentum so there needs to be something
6:05
to get these giant molecular clouds to
6:08
begin collapsing
6:09
for example clouds can just randomly
Triggered Star Formation
6:12
collide and that can get a couple of
6:15
rotating clouds to combine together
6:17
forming clumps and increasing the
6:19
rotational velocity massive stars can
6:22
explode as supernovae and these can send
6:25
shockwaves through interstellar space if
6:27
these shockwaves collide with a giant
6:30
molecular cloud that can cause that
6:32
cloud to fragment and collapse into
6:35
multiple stars or in a kind of a chicken
6:38
and egg scenario
6:40
we can have what we see here the
6:42
presence of these very young massive
6:45
stars at the center of this nebula can
6:48
trigger star formation by flooding the
6:51
entire region with ultraviolet radiation
6:54
and superfast stellar winds that kind of
6:57
slam in to the denser cooler gas around
7:00
it forming these tight knots and clumps
7:03
and each of the clumps that you see here
7:05
in this image are the cocoons of a young
7:08
forming protostar within and when stars
7:12
are reaching the end of their formation
7:14
stages they often go into what's called
7:16
a teatari star phase so we're talking
7:20
about stars that are about the same mass
7:22
of the Sun and they aren't yet fusing
7:25
hydrogen in their cores yet but they're
7:27
about to and T star II stars are often
7:30
characterized by the presence of
7:31
circumstellar disks and by these very
7:34
fast stellar winds so in this image
7:37
we're looking at v1 3:31 signe the
7:40
circumstellar disk is seen more or less
7:42
face-on and if we could take an
7:44
imaginary view of this same disc kind of
7:46
at an angle you'll see what's going on
7:48
what's happening is that the protostar
7:50
is emitting a very fast
7:52
stellar wind but the disc itself is made
7:56
of such cool dense gas and dust that it
7:58
has the effect of confining the outflow
8:00
of that stellar wind pretty much along
8:03
the axis of its own rotation in other
8:05
words the outflow is basically being
8:08
channeled out through the poles now
8:10
sometimes this outflow is very intense
8:13
and when we look in places like the
8:16
Carina Nebula remember every one of
8:18
these knots every one of these clumps is
8:20
a forming star system in and of itself
8:25
however when we look into the upper
8:28
right corner of this image you'll see
8:29
that there's a very pronounced jet of
8:32
material that's blasting out in a
8:35
bipolar fashion now when this stuff is
8:38
being ejected out at very high speeds
8:40
this has the effect of getting rid of
8:43
some of that angular momentum and that's
8:45
important because if the star were to
8:48
somehow keep all of its angular momentum
8:49
it would have to rotate so fast that it
8:52
would literally tear itself
8:54
part and when this material slams into
8:58
the surrounding dust and nebulosity it
9:01
ionizing that gas and it causes it to
9:04
glow
9:05
so these jets these glowing jets are
9:08
known as herbig-haro objects and they're
9:10
really just the high velocity jet
9:12
slamming in at hundreds of kilometers
9:14
per second now we think these are
9:16
relatively short duration events in
9:19
other words we don't think that these
9:20
last very long may be on the order of a
9:22
couple thousand maybe to a hundred
9:25
thousand years or so but remember that
9:27
the formation of these stars take place
9:29
over tens of millions of years now we're
9:32
lucky here we get to actually see both
9:34
lobes of the jet often times however we
9:38
have a very dense pillar of gas in this
9:40
particular case that's blocking one of
9:43
those jets from view luckily though we
9:46
can explore this region at infrared and
9:50
submillimetre wavelengths that allows us
9:52
to see through much of that blocking gas
9:55
and dust revealing both lobes in the
9:58
process
9:59
so these herbig-haro objects really seem
HH 30: protostar, disk, and jet
10:03
to herald the arrival of a newly forming
10:06
star so this is a very well-studied
10:08
object HH 30 it may not look very
10:11
impressive because we are looking at the
10:14
individual pixels on the Hubble Space
10:17
Telescope's main camera but there are
10:19
still some very familiar features first
10:22
of all we have the jet which is being
10:24
emitted at a rate of about 300
10:26
kilometers per second there's also a lot
10:29
of light from the star itself being
10:31
reflected or scattered from the disk now
10:33
the disk itself is in silhouette and
10:36
that's because deep at the center is the
10:38
protostar itself hidden from our view
10:40
and to keep the scale in mind let's just
10:43
consider the radius of this disk
10:45
it's about 430 astronomical units
10:49
remember the semi-major axis of neptune
10:52
is about 30 astronomical units so this
10:55
is an extremely still an extremely very
10:58
very large system that is still in the
11:02
process of collapsing so what we think
11:04
is happening is that the star itself is
11:06
about to switch
11:07
John and there are presumably planets
11:11
inside this disk that are forming from
11:14
the disk material itself best of all we
11:17
can take images of these phenomena over
11:20
and over again and over a 14-year period
11:23
this particular jet was captured by the
11:26
Hubble Space Telescope so we can
11:28
actually watch how it moves through
11:30
space we don't have to pretend or assume
11:32
that this is happening we can see it
11:34
happening over time now we only have one
11:37
of the two Jets the other jet would be
11:39
moving toward the left of your screen
11:42
however it's concealed behind a dense
11:45
molecular cloud so we have a story that
11:50
we're starting to fit together about how
11:52
stars form there are these proto stellar
11:56
or protoplanetary disks that surround
11:59
newly forming stars and it seems that
12:02
every star that forms starts out with a
12:04
disc like this but not all these disks
12:07
have jets associated with them so the
12:11
Jets themselves are probably transient
12:14
events in fact if you look at this
12:16
object on the right side of your screen
12:18
you're gonna see little knots it's
12:21
almost as if there were like bullets of
12:23
material that were being ejected from
12:25
the star so this tells us that the Jets
12:28
themselves probably turn on and turn off
12:30
and turn back on again at various times
12:32
throughout the stars formation so quick
12:37
anatomy and recap we have the
12:39
circumstellar disk all this is the
12:42
rotating gas and dust and it's
12:43
flattening out due to the conservation
12:45
of angular momentum the inner disk is
12:48
rotating the fastest and therefore it's
12:51
the flattest part of the system this
12:54
inner disk is what directly feeds the
12:56
protostar and that's why it's often
12:58
called an accretion or a proto stellar
13:01
disk the protostar itself is hidden from
13:03
view it's directly at the center and
13:06
it's this disk that confines the outflow
13:09
of the proto stellar wind along the
13:11
poles and sometimes the outflow is
13:13
intense enough to create a jet so far
13:17
we've been talking about the formation
13:19
of stars that are approximately the mass
13:21
of the Sun but it turns out the same
13:23
phenomena is true even of massive stars
13:26
like this one this is a 15 solar mass
13:29
star called Sharples 2 - 106 and as the
13:33
picture may indicate it's the same
13:35
process just happening on a much much
13:37
larger scale so we have the protostar
13:41
itself which is basically hidden from
13:43
view we don't really even see the
13:45
protostar but this massive bipolar
13:49
outflow and you could just see all the
13:50
different knots that suggest how the
13:53
stuff has been colliding with the
13:55
interstellar medium so this whole system
13:58
is about two light-years from one end to
14:02
the next so this is just the same thing
14:04
that happened to our solar system except
14:06
obviously on a much larger scale now
14:09
most of the stars in the sky are
Binary system formation
14:11
actually members of binary systems so
14:14
here is an example of a forming binary
14:16
system this is HK tari
14:19
and we have two separate discs so we
14:22
have two stars each forming from within
14:24
their own discs and since these two
14:27
discs and the 2 proto stars within are
14:29
gravitationally bound they will
14:32
undoubtedly go on to become a proper
14:34
binary star system these discs and the
14:37
stars forming within them will continue
14:39
to orbit one another but sometimes a
14:42
binary or even in this case a triple
14:45
star system can form from within the
14:48
same disk what we have is a single disk
14:50
and it looks like what's happened is
14:52
that the disk has fragmented and it's
14:55
this fragmentation of the disk that gave
14:57
rise to additional clumps or additional
15:01
cores so here's an artist's impression
15:03
of a similar system GG tari a it looks
15:06
like we had the primary star at the
15:08
centre and then from somewhere within
15:11
the disk some instability formed and
15:14
rather than accreting onto the main star
15:16
at the center it formed its own
15:18
accretion disk around a second protostar
15:22
as the protostar continues to develop
15:26
the remaining disk is flattening and
15:28
then little clumps form inside that disk
15:32
and go on to become planets
15:34
so we're going to learn more about the
15:36
formation of planetary systems next
