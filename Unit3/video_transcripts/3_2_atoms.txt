What are Atoms?
0:06
Everything we can see and even those gases that we cannot see
0:10
are made up of atoms.
0:12
In short,
0:12
all matter is made up of atoms.
0:15
Atoms are so small that we cannot see them with our naked eyes.
What atoms are made of
0:18
More fascinating thing
0:20
is that atoms themselves are made of smaller particles,
0:23
such as the positively charged protons,
0:25
negatively charged electrons,
0:27
and some particles with no charge, called neutrons.
Subatomic particles
0:31
We can collectively call protons, neutrons, and electrons;
0:34
subatomic particles.
Proton
0:36
A proton has a relative charge of +1
0:39
and a relative mass of 1,
Neutron
0:42
while a neutron has a relative charge of 0
0:45
and a relative mass of 1,
Electron
0:47
and an electron has a relative charge of -1
0:50
and a relative mass of 1/1840.
0:54
It is represented by the symbol e,
0:56
Protons are represented by the symbol p,
0:59
while neutrons, by the symbol n.
1:02
The protons and neutrons are tightly packed together
1:04
in the nucleus of the atom.
1:06
This gives the nucleus an overall positive charge.
Nucleus of an atom
1:09
The nucleus, as the name suggests,
1:11
is located in the centre of the atom.
1:14
The electrons move rapidly around the nucleus.
1:16
When the elements are different,
1:18
the amount of protons will also different.
1:21
Moreover,
1:22
the number of electrons and protons in an atom are equal.
1:26
This makes every atom electrically neutral.
1:29
This is because negative charges cancel out positive charges.
Proton number or atomic number
1:33
Proton Number
1:34
The Proton Number is the number of protons in an atom.
1:37
The proton number is also called the atomic number.
1:40
It is represented by the symbol Z.
1:43
Since atoms are electrically neutral,
1:45
the proton number also tells us the number of electrons in the atom.
1:48
For example,
1:49
the proton number of hydrogen is 1,
1:52
carbon is 6,
1:53
and oxygen is 8.
1:55
This means hydrogen has 1 proton and 1 electron,
1:59
carbon has 6 protons and 6 electrons,
2:02
and oxygen has 8 protons and 8 electrons.
2:05
Another important thing to remember
2:07
is that each element has a unique proton number.
Nucleon number or mass number
2:10
Nucleon Number
2:11
The nucleon number of an atom
2:13
is the total number of protons and neutrons in the atom
2:16
and is represented by the symbol capital A.
2:19
Nucleon number is also used to serve the mass number,
2:23
The mass of electrons is much lighter than the other two.
2:26
So, it is negligible
2:28
that the mass of an atom only depends on the number of protons and neutrons
2:31
in the atom nucleus.
2:33
To simplify,
Formula of nucleon number
2:34
Nucleon number, A,
2:36
equals to the number of protons + the number of neutrons.
How elements are written in the periodic table
2:39
In the periodic table of elements,
2:41
an element is written as AZX.
2:44
Where X is the chemical symbol of the element,
2:47
A is the nucleon number or mass number,
2:50
written in superscript left of the symbol,
2:53
and Z is the proton number or atomic number in subscript,
2:56
also left of the symbol.
