    "Molecular clouds are the cold, dense regions of space where stars are born. These clouds are primarily composed of hydrogen molecules (Hâ‚‚), along with helium and trace amounts of heavier elements. They have a temperature range of 10-20 K and densities that are significantly higher than the surrounding interstellar medium.\n",

    "## Stages of Star Formation\n",
    "\n",
    "Star formation occurs through a series of stages, beginning with the gravitational collapse of a molecular cloud and ending with the ignition of nuclear fusion in the core of a new star.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gravitational Collapse:**\n",
    "- **Initial Trigger**: Events like supernova shockwaves or galactic collisions can compress parts of a molecular cloud, initiating gravitational collapse.\n",
    "- **Fragmentation**: The collapsing cloud fragments into smaller clumps, each of which can form a star.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Protostar Formation:**\n",
    "- **Protostellar Phase**: As the cloud fragments collapse, they form dense cores that heat up, becoming protostars.\n",
    "- **Accretion Disks**: Material continues to fall onto the protostar, forming a rotating disk around it.\n",
    "- **T Tauri Stars**: Young, variable stars often found in star-forming regions.\n",
    "- **Herbig-Haro Objects**: Bright patches of nebulosity associated with newborn stars.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Ignition of Nuclear Fusion:**\n",
    "- **Conditions for Fusion**: When the core temperature and pressure become high enough, nuclear fusion ignites.\n",
    "- **Main Sequence Star**: The protostar transitions to a main sequence star, where it will spend most of its life fusing hydrogen into helium.\n",

    "\n",
    "Angular momentum is conserved during the collapse of a molecular cloud, leading to the formation of rotating accretion disks and bipolar outflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: As the cloud collapses, it spins faster, conserving angular momentum.\n",
    "- **Accretion Disks**: The rotating material forms a disk around the protostar.\n",

    "- **Dense Star Clusters**: Stars form in close proximity, leading to frequent interactions.\n",
    "- **Isolated Regions**: Stars form individually or in small groups, leading to different evolutionary pathways.\n",
