    "# 3.5 Life Cycle of Stars\n",
    "\n",
    "Stars are the building blocks of galaxies, and understanding their life cycle provides crucial insights into the workings of the universe. From the brilliant birth of a star to its final breath as a stellar remnant, the evolution of stars is a complex and fascinating journey governed primarily by one key factor: **mass**. In this lesson, we will explore how the initial mass of a star dictates its life path, the stages stars go through, and the remnants they leave behind.\n",

    "## Initial Mass and Its Impact on Stellar Evolution\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important factor in determining a star’s evolution is its initial mass. The initial mass determines not only how long the star will live but also the different stages it will go through and its final fate. Stars are classified into three main categories based on their mass:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Low-mass stars** (up to 0.5 solar masses): These stars have long lifespans, typically tens of billions of years.\n",
    "- **Intermediate-mass stars** (between 0.5 and 8 solar masses): These stars have moderate lifespans, ranging from hundreds of millions to a few billion years.\n",
    "- **High-mass stars** (greater than 8 solar masses): These stars have short but dramatic lifespans, often only a few million years.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Does Mass Matter?\n",
    "The greater the mass of a star, the higher the core temperature and pressure. This means that high-mass stars can sustain more vigorous nuclear fusion, leading to shorter lifespans but more spectacular end-of-life events, such as supernovae. In contrast, low-mass stars burn their fuel more slowly, leading to longer lifespans and more peaceful ends as white dwarfs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "<h4>Stellar Lifetimes</h4> A low-mass star like our Sun will live for approximately 10 billion years, slowly fusing hydrogen into helium. In contrast, a massive star 20 times the mass of the Sun might live for only 10 million years before exploding as a supernova.\n",

    "## The Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) Diagram as a Tool for Understanding Stellar Evolution\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) Diagram** is one of the most important tools in astronomy for understanding stellar evolution. The diagram plots stars according to their luminosity and surface temperature, revealing distinct patterns that correspond to different stages of stellar life.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Regions of the H-R Diagram:\n",
    "- **Main Sequence**: Where stars spend most of their lives, fusing hydrogen into helium. About 90% of stars fall on the main sequence, with their position determined by mass—more massive stars are hotter and more luminous, while low-mass stars are cooler and dimmer.\n",
    "- **Red Giants and Supergiants**: Large, cool stars that have exhausted their hydrogen and moved on to fuse heavier elements. These stars occupy the upper-right region of the diagram, indicating high luminosity despite their relatively cool surface temperatures.\n",
    "- **White Dwarfs**: Hot but dim remnants of low- and intermediate-mass stars, found in the lower-left region of the diagram. These stars are small but have very high surface temperatures.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Stellar Radii and the H-R Diagram:\n",
    "The H-R Diagram also allows astronomers to infer stellar radii. If two stars have the same surface temperature but one is more luminous, the more luminous star must have a larger radius. This explains why supergiants can be cool but extremely luminous—they have enormous surface areas. Conversely, white dwarfs are hot but dim because of their small size.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Distribution of Stars:\n",
    "It's important to recognize that the distribution of stars on the H-R Diagram does not fully represent the true population of stars in the universe. While many stars we observe are on the main sequence, faint stars like red dwarfs are underrepresented due to their low brightness and distance from us. Understanding this helps astronomers make more accurate models of stellar populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<h4>The H-R Diagram</h4> The H-R Diagram is often compared to the periodic table in chemistry—just as the periodic table organizes elements by their properties, the H-R Diagram organizes stars by their temperature and luminosity. It also helps astronomers estimate stellar radii and understand the diverse evolutionary paths of stars.\n",

    "## Main Sequence Evolution\n",
    "\n",
    "Stars spend the majority of their lives on the **main sequence**, where they fuse hydrogen into helium in their cores. This is the most stable and longest phase of a star’s life. The position of a star on the main sequence depends on its mass: more massive stars are hotter and more luminous, placing them higher on the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) Diagram.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Helium and Heavier Element Fusion\n",
    "- **Helium Burning**: After hydrogen is depleted, the core contracts and heats up, allowing helium to fuse into carbon and oxygen in a process called the **triple-alpha process**.\n",
    "- **Carbon, Oxygen, and Silicon Burning**: In high-mass stars, the core continues to contract and heat up, enabling the fusion of heavier elements like carbon, oxygen, and silicon. These stages are much shorter and more energetic than hydrogen fusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, high-mass stars create iron in their cores, which cannot undergo fusion to release energy. This leads to a catastrophic core collapse, resulting in a supernova explosion.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Intermediate-mass stars** follow a similar path, often creating **planetary nebulae** as they lose their outer layers.\n",
    "- **High-mass stars** evolve into **supergiants** and end their lives in spectacular **supernova** explosions, leaving behind **neutron stars** or **black holes**.\n",

    "1. **White Dwarfs**: These are the remnants of low- and intermediate-mass stars. A white dwarf is incredibly dense, with a mass comparable to the Sun but packed into a volume similar to Earth’s. Over billions of years, white dwarfs cool and fade into **black dwarfs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Neutron Stars**: The remnants of supernova explosions from stars with masses between about 8 and 20 solar masses. Neutron stars are even denser than white dwarfs, with a mass greater than the Sun compressed into a sphere just a few kilometers across. **Pulsars**, a type of neutron star, emit beams of radiation as they rotate.\n",
