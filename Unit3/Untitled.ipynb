    "### Case Study: Supernova 1987A\n",
    "\n",
    "Supernova 1987A (SN 1987A) offers a rare look at the final stages of massive stars. Discovered on February 24, 1987, in the Large Magellanic Cloud, it was the closest supernova observed in nearly 400 years, just 160,000 light-years away. The progenitor star, Sanduleak -69° 202, was a blue supergiant about 20 times the mass of the Sun.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stellar Evolution and the Supernova Event\n",
    "\n",
    "Sanduleak -69° 202 lived most of its life fusing hydrogen into helium as a main-sequence star, with a luminosity 60,000 times that of the Sun. After exhausting its hydrogen, it expanded into a red supergiant and later reverted to a blue supergiant before collapsing in a type II supernova. The explosion was powerful enough to outshine its entire galaxy for weeks, ejecting the star’s outer layers and creating an expanding shell of gas and dust.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Observations and Legacy\n",
    "\n",
    "Post-explosion, the Hubble Space Telescope revealed a glowing ring of gas around SN 1987A, likely expelled during the star's red supergiant phase. The collision of the supernova shockwave with this ring provided stunning visuals and valuable data. Additionally, the detection of neutrinos confirmed theoretical models of core-collapse supernovae, providing direct evidence of neutron star formation.\n",
    "\n",
    "SN 1987A has greatly advanced our understanding of massive star life cycles, supernova mechanics, and nucleosynthesis—the formation of elements in stars. It remains a cornerstone in astrophysics, offering insights that continue to shape our knowledge of the cosmos.\n",
