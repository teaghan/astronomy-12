## Unit 3: Stars

This unit explores the fascinating life cycles of stars, from their formation in molecular clouds to their ultimate demise as white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. It covers the processes that power stars, their chemical compositions, and the physical principles that govern their radiation.

### Teacher Assessment
- Summary Notes
- Assignment/Project

### Self-Assessment
- Each section of this unit includes a set of "Check Your Understanding" questions that are designed to prepare you for the midterm exam.

### [Summary Notes](https://teaghan.github.io/astronomy-12/Unit3/Unit3_Summary_Notes.pdf)

- While going through the lessons, working on the Check Your Understanding problems, and completing any assignment/project, you are expected to take meaningful notes for your future self. These notes can include concepts, diagrams, examples, etc.
- **You will be allowed to access these notes during the test!**
- Print out the summary notes file and fill it with useful, hand-written notes while working through this unit and submit your notes at the end of the unit to be assessed for completion.
- There is a suggested set of topics as well as empty boxes to give you the opportunity to summarize additional topics.
