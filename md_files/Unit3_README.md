## Unit 3: Stars

This unit explores the fascinating life cycles of stars, from their formation in molecular clouds to their ultimate demise as white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. It covers the processes that power stars, their chemical compositions, and the physical principles that govern their radiation.
