# 4.5 Spectroscopy II: Applications of Spectroscopy

- **Identifying Elements in Stars**: How spectroscopy is used to identify the chemical composition of stars.
- **Measuring Stellar Velocities**: Discussion of the Doppler effect and how radial velocity measurements are used to study stellar motion and detect exoplanets.
- **The Science of Spectroscopy**:
   - Overview of line lists, catalogs of spectral lines, and how they are used in practical spectroscopic analysis.
   - Measure stellar temperatures, using the position of absorption/emission lines and line broadening.
   - Study stellar motion and detect exoplanets using the Doppler shift of spectral lines.
