## Unit 4: Light and Spectroscopy

This unit explores the nature of light and how it interacts with matter. It covers the electromagnetic spectrum, wave-particle duality, and the use of spectroscopy in astronomy.


### 4.1 Nature of Light
- Electromagnetic Spectrum.
- Wave-Particle Duality.

### 4.2 Blackbody Radiation
   - Planck’s Law and Spectrum: Describing the spectrum of radiation emitted by a blackbody.
   - Wien’s Displacement Law: Relating temperature to the peak wavelength of blackbody radiation.
   - Stefan-Boltzmann Law: Relating the total energy radiated per unit surface area to the fourth power of its temperature.

### 4.3 Formation of Spectral Lines
- Physical processes behind spectral lines.

### 4.4 Spectroscopy in Astronomy
- Absorption and Emission Spectra.
- Doppler Effect.

### 4.5 Applications of Spectroscopy
- Identifying elements in stars.
- Measuring stellar velocities.
