    "# 1.1 A Brief History of Astronomy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "Imagine looking up at the night sky thousands of years ago, without the light pollution of modern cities. The stars would be a dazzling spectacle, a cosmic mystery waiting to be unraveled. This lesson will take you on a journey through time, exploring how humanity has sought to understand the universe, from ancient stargazers to modern astronomers. Join us as we discover the fascinating story of astronomyâ€”a tale of curiosity, ingenuity, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge.\n",

    "  <h4>Video</h4>\n",
    "  <p>Watch <a href=\"https://youtu.be/0rHUDWjR5gg?si=NJL_XCQq9rRs723c\">this video</a> for an excellent introduction to the study of Astronomy. Importantly, the video includes a discussion on the various careers related to astronomy.</p>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Ancient Roots of Astronomy\n",
    "Our story begins in ancient Babylon and Egypt, where early astronomers meticulously observed the skies. These civilizations recorded the movements of celestial bodies, using their observations to predict events like eclipses and the flooding of the Nile. The Babylonians developed star catalogs, while the Egyptians created a 365-day calendar based on the heliacal rising of Sirius.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we move forward in time, we encounter the Greeks, who made significant contributions to our understanding of the cosmos. Pythagoras proposed a mathematical harmony in nature, influencing later cosmologies. Aristotle argued for a spherical Earth, based on the shape of Earth's shadow during lunar eclipses.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](figures/Aristotle.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Eratosthenes, a brilliant mathematician, measured Earth's circumference with remarkable accuracy using the angles of shadows in different locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](figures/Eratosthenes.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Alexandria, Claudius Ptolemy developed the geocentric model, which placed Earth at the center of the universe, with planets and stars orbiting it in complex patterns of circles within circles. This model dominated astronomical thought for over a thousand years.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](figures/Ptolemy.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Copernican Revolution\n",
    "The scene shifts to Renaissance Europe, where a quiet revolution was brewing. Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish astronomer, proposed a heliocentric model that placed the Sun at the center of the universe. This radical idea challenged the long-held geocentric model and set the stage for a seismic shift in our understanding of the cosmos.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](figures/Copernicus.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter Galileo Galilei, the Italian polymath who used a telescope to observe the heavens like never before. Galileo discovered moons orbiting Jupiter and phases of Venus, providing concrete evidence for the heliocentric model. His findings sparked a clash with the Catholic Church, illustrating the tension between science and established beliefs.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](figures/Galileo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Johannes Kepler, a contemporary of Galileo, formulated three laws of planetary motion, describing the orbits of planets as ellipses rather than circles. Kepler's laws revolutionized our understanding of planetary motion and paved the way for further discoveries.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](figures/Kepler.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Isaac Newton, the English mathematician and physicist, provided the theoretical foundation for Kepler's laws with his laws of motion and universal gravitation. Newton's work unified the physical description of the universe and laid the groundwork for classical mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Birth of Modern Astronomy\n",
    "Our journey continues into the 18th century with William Herschel, who discovered Uranus and used large telescopes to catalog thousands of stars and nebulae. Herschel's work expanded our understanding of the cosmos and revealed the vastness of the universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The development of spectroscopy in the 19th century marked a new era in astronomy. Joseph Fraunhofer discovered dark lines in the solar spectrum, leading to the identification of chemical elements in stars. Gustav Kirchhoff and Robert Bunsen further advanced this field, allowing astronomers to determine the composition of stars and other celestial bodies.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](figures/Fraunhofer.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Edwin Hubble, in the early 20th century, made a groundbreaking discovery that the universe is expanding. By observing the redshift of galaxies, Hubble provided the first evidence for the Big Bang theory, reshaping our understanding of the universe's origins and evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recent Advances\n",
    "The 20th and 21st centuries have seen incredible advancements in astronomy. The Hubble Space Telescope has provided stunning images of deep space, transforming our understanding of the universe's structure and origins.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](figures/HST.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Radio and X-ray astronomy have revealed exotic objects like pulsars and quasars, and the cosmic microwave background radiation has given us a glimpse into the universe's early stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](figures/CMB.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The discovery of exoplanets has expanded our search for potentially habitable worlds, with missions like the Kepler Space Telescope identifying thousands of planets around other stars.\n",
