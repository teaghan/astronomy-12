    "# 1.4 The Brightness of Stars\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever gazed up at the night sky and wondered why some stars shine brighter than others? The study of stellar brightness not only allows us to appreciate the beauty of the cosmos but also provides crucial information about the stars themselves. In this lesson, we'll explore how astronomers measure the brightness of stars, the physics behind their luminosity, and the historical context of the magnitude scale.\n",

    "### Flux and Luminosity\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand stellar brightness, we first need to define a few key concepts: flux and luminosity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flux** is the amount of light energy received per unit area per unit time. Imagine standing under a streetlamp at night. The light that hits you is the flux.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Luminosity**, on the other hand, is the total amount of energy a star emits per unit time. Think of it as the star's total power output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Inverse Square Law\n",
    "\n",
    "As light travels from a star, it spreads out over an ever-increasing area. This spreading out follows the **Inverse Square Law**, which states that the flux decreases with the square of the distance from the source. Mathematically, we express this as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F = \\frac{L}{4\\pi r^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $F$ is the flux (in watts per square meter, $\\text{W/m}^2$),\n",
    "- $L$ is the luminosity (in watts, $\\text{W}$),\n",
    "- $r$ is the distance from the star (in meters, $\\text{m}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "> This law explains why stars appear dimmer the farther away they are. It's not because they're less powerful, but because their light spreads out over a larger area.\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "<b>Example:</b> Calculating the Solar Flux at Different Distances\n",

    "\n",
    "> The luminosity of the Sun is $ 3.839 \\times 10^{26} $ W and is at a distance of 1 AU (astronomical unit) away from Earth, which is $ 1.496 \\times 10^{11} $ meters.\n",

    "## Apparent Brightness and the Magnitude Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "### Apparent Magnitude\n",
    "\n",
    "The **apparent magnitude** of a star is a measure of its brightness as seen from Earth. This concept is crucial because it takes into account both the intrinsic luminosity of the star and its distance from us.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Historical Background of the Magnitude Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "The magnitude scale dates back to the ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus, who classified stars according to their apparent brightness. This system was refined by Ptolemy and later standardized to a logarithmic scale, where a difference of 5 magnitudes corresponds to a factor of 100 in brightness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logarithmic nature of the scale is represented by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ m_1 - m_2 = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{F_1}{F_2} \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ are the magnitudes of two stars, and $ F_1 $ and $ F_2 $ are their respective fluxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to write this equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{F_2}{F_1} = \\left(100^{0.2}\\right)^{m_1 - m_2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "which allows us to compare the flux of two objects (and the flux is what we would typically call \"brightness\" in every day conversation).\n",
    "\n",
    "> The star Vega was historically used as the standard for apparent magnitude, set at 0. Modern measurements have slightly adjusted this value, but Vega remains a key reference point in the magnitude system.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Recall:</b> A logarithm is a mathematical operator that tells us the power to which a base number must be raised to obtain a given number. When the base is not specified, it is assumed to be 10.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "> For example, $ \\log_{10}(100) = 2 $ because $ 10^2 = 100 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logarithmic scales are used in astronomy to manage the huge differences in the brightness and distances of celestial objects.\n",

    "## Absolute Magnitude\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude (brightness) a star would have if it were placed at a standard distance of 10 parsecs from Earth. This standardization allows astronomers to compare the true brightness of stars without the confounding effect of distance.\n",

    "$$ m - M = 5 \\log_{10}(d) - 5 $$\n",
    "\n",
