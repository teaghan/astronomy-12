    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "In this lesson, we will delve into the basics of astronomy, its importance, and the phenomena observed in the night sky. We will also explore the concept of magnitudes, including apparent and absolute magnitudes, which are crucial for understanding the brightness of celestial objects.\n",

    "### Introduction to Astronomy\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine gazing up at the night sky, seeing a tapestry of stars, planets, and distant galaxies. This natural curiosity about the universe has driven humans to explore the cosmos for millennia. Astronomy, the study of celestial objects and phenomena, helps us understand our place in the universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discussion Points:**\n",
    "- What is astronomy, and why is it important?\n",
    "- The evolution of astronomy from ancient times to modern science.\n",

    "While the night sky appears serene and unchanging, human activity has introduced a new challenge for astronomers: light pollution. Light pollution refers to the brightening of the night sky caused by street lights, buildings, and other artificial sources, which obscure our view of stars and planets.\n",

    "### Understanding Magnitudes\n",
    "\n",
    "In ancient Greece, the astronomer Hipparchus devised a system to rank stars by their brightness, which laid the foundation for our modern magnitude system. Today, magnitudes help astronomers quantify and compare the brightness of celestial objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Concept:**\n",
    "- **Magnitude** is a measure of the brightness of a celestial object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Magnitudes:**\n",
    "- **Apparent Magnitude**: The brightness of a celestial object as seen from Earth.\n",
    "- **Absolute Magnitude**: The intrinsic brightness of a celestial object, defined as the apparent magnitude the object would have if it were placed at a standard distance of 10 parsecs from Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Historical Background:**\n",
    "- The magnitude system dates back to the Greek astronomer Hipparchus, who ranked stars based on their brightness.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Apparent Magnitude\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine looking up at the night sky and noticing that some stars are much brighter than others. This difference in brightness is captured by the concept of apparent magnitude. Apparent magnitude (m) is a measure of how bright a celestial object appears from Earth. A lower apparent magnitude indicates a brighter object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- Apparent magnitude (m) depends on the object's intrinsic brightness and its distance from Earth.\n",
    "- A lower apparent magnitude means a brighter object.\n",
    "- Examples: Sirius has an apparent magnitude of -1.46, while the faintest stars visible to the naked eye are around magnitude 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "m = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{F}{F_0} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( F \\) is the observed flux, and \\( F_0 \\) is a reference flux.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Absolute Magnitude\n",
    "\n",
    "To truly compare the brightness of stars, astronomers use absolute magnitude (M), which normalizes the brightness of a star to a standard distance of 10 parsecs. This removes the effect of distance, allowing for a fair comparison of intrinsic brightness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- Absolute magnitude (M) provides a way to compare the true brightness of celestial objects.\n",
    "- It normalizes the brightness to a standard distance, removing the effects of distance.\n",
    "- Examples: The Sun has an absolute magnitude of +4.83.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M = m + 5 - 5 \\log_{10} (d)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $d$ is the distance to the star in parsecs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relationship Between Apparent and Absolute Magnitudes:**\n",
    "- Distance modulus formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "m - M = 5 \\log_{10} (d) - 5\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula relates the apparent magnitude, absolute magnitude, and distance to the celestial object.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "<b>Example 1:</b> Calculate the apparent magnitude of a star that is 100 times less bright than a reference star with an apparent magnitude of 0.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** \n",
    "Using the formula $ m = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{F}{F_0} \\right) $:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "m = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{1}{100} \\right) = -2.5 \\log_{10} (0.01) = -2.5 \\times (-2) = 5\n",
