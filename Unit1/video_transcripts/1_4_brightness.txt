Welcome to Learn the Sky, your online resource  for learning about the stars and constellations.  
0:07
At some point in your life as you have  been stargazing, you've probably noticed  
0:11
that some stars are brighter than others. Even other objects like planets stand out more  
0:17
than some of the bright stars in the sky. When  astronomers talk about star brightness they use  
0:24
something called magnitude. When I say magnitude  I'm talking about the brightness of a star. 
0:31
Take this constellation for example. This  is the constellation known as Ursa Major. 
0:36
As you're looking at this group of stars  you might notice this pattern, these seven stars,  
0:43
are an asterism called the Big Dipper. It has  many other names in many other cultures. I can't  
0:49
even pretend that I know all the names of this  particular asterism or star pattern but these  
0:56
seven stars are of relatively the same brightness  and that's what makes it easy to find in the sky.  
1:03
That's how you can tell its difference from  Ursa Minor which is the Little Dipper. Here is the  
1:09
actual full constellation of Ursa Major. As you  can see, these stars are of different brightnesses.
1:16
In this video, we are going to explore  what the magnitude of a star really means  
1:23
and how it's changed over the years. We're going  to review a really quick history of star magnitude  
Brief History of Star Magnitude
1:30
and how it came to be. From what we know, at this  time, Hipparchus was the Greek astronomer who lived  
1:36
in the 2nd century. He was the first to start  this star brightness classification. He classified  
1:44
850 stars ranging from 1 to 6 in terms  of brightness. So what did this look like  
1:50
for Hipparchus? If you look at this picture, here you can see that there are a range of star  
1:56
brightnesses. He said the brightest stars like Rigel, right here, in the constellation of Orion  
2:04
would be a first magnitude star because  it's very bright. Then the fainter stars, 
2:10
ones that are up here that are very tiny  little pinpoints and don't really stand out, 
2:15
those faint stars would be of sixth magnitude.  This was really used by astronomers for the past  
2:22
2,000 plus years. As you look at this photo,  can see there are different brightnesses and how  
2:30
do you define them? There's a lot of questions here  that I had, but what I did learn is that over time  
2:38
this system became a little bit more refined. Also with the help of technology of course.
2:45
The next character we have in our story of  star magnitude is Ptolemy and he was a Roman  
2:50
mathematician and astronomer that expanded on  the work of Hipparchus. He still retained that six  
2:56
range brightness classification with 1 being the  brightest and 6 being the faintest. Now we're  
3:02
gonna fast forward towards Galileo's time. When  he looked at the night sky through his telescope  
3:09
he was able to see these invisible stars  stars that you wouldn't normally see  
3:14
with the naked eye because they're just too faint. He started labeling these invisible stars as  
3:20
seventh magnitude. He continued Hipparchus  magnitude scale but also expanded on it.
3:29
Then we're gonna skip on over to 1856. An  english astronomer known as Norman Robert Pogson  
3:37
standardized this magnitude system because that's  what scientists do; they standardize. We have to  
3:42
standardize our measurements so we know what it  is that we're measuring. He concluded that a first  
3:48
magnitude star is 100 times brighter than a 6  magnitude star. This established a logarithmic  
3:55
scale. Astronomers also look at magnitude from  two different lenses and I want to explore that  
4:04
in the next part of this video. Another lens  that astronomers use in magnitude is the  
Apparent versus Absolute Magnitude
4:10
concept of apparent magnitude versus absolute  magnitude. Apparent magnitude is probably what  
4:16
you're most familiar with. That's the  brightness of a star as it appears to us. 
4:20
With absolute magnitude, it's a little bit  different. Astronomers will look at the brightness  
4:25
of an object if it were at a particular  distance. So, apparent magnitude, as you're looking  
4:31
at this picture is the brightness as it appears to  us the observer. For example, this is the Pleiades
4:38
star cluster that has a relatively lower magnitude  which means it's brighter. We're going to  
4:45
explore this scale in a little bit, so stick with  me. But, absolute magnitude is when scientists will  
4:52
measure the brightness of a celestial object if  it was at a particular distance from earth. That  
4:58
distance being 10 parsecs. So, if we're here on  Earth and a star was placed at 10 parsecs away,  
5:06
32.6 light years, how bright would it be? So we  can have two different values for magnitude based  
5:15
upon the lens at which you're looking at. Let's  get an example of this. So this star, right here.
5:21
This is Aldebaran in the constellation of  Taurus. It has an apparent magnitude of 0.87, 
5:29
so very close to 1 which tells us it's a bright  object, but its absolute magnitude is -0.63.
5:38
This seems confusing because it's like, "Oh does  that mean it's brighter or dimmer?" I do want to  
5:43
go ahead and explore the difference between the  negative which are usually brighter numbers.  
5:49
Then, the positive. The bigger the number the dimmer  it is. I wanted to just go over this concept of  
5:56
Aldebaran having two different types of magnitude. One being what we see from our perspective  
6:02
and one being if it this star was placed at a  particular distance what would the brightness be.
6:10
So let's take a look at some of the examples of  different stars we see in the sky versus what  
Examples Star Magnitude
6:15
their magnitude would be. I'm purely speaking  of apparent magnitude. Remember the scale works  
6:21
in reverse. So the lower the magnitude  the brighter the star. Let's take this  
6:26
timeline, or number line, I should say. We're  going to place some different stars on here and  
6:31
show you where they lie. So first, we'll start  with Vega. Vega is in the constellation Lyra. I  
6:37
have a video about that. Go check it out. It has a magnitude of 0 which tells us  
6:42
it's a pretty bright object in the sky. But, if we  look at a star like Polaris, the North Star, the  
6:50
star that doesn't appear to move. I've got a video  on that one. That has a magnitude of two. So vega  
6:56
is brighter than Polaris even though the number is  bigger with Polaris. Remember inverse relationship.
7:02
Our limit that we can see with the naked eye is  6.So anything at a magnitude 6 is the limit that  
7:10
we can see. If you start going to 7; 8; 9. you need  magnification to see anything that is above a 6.  
7:21
If we keep going here. Sirius, the brightest  star in the night sky in the constellation
7:25
Canis Major. I've got a video on it. Go see it if  you want to learn more. That star is negative 1.5, 
7:33
so it's really bright when you compare it to say- Well I don't want to say really, really bright but  
7:41
and I'm not going to get into the mathematics  of this. If we bounce back to Polaris  
7:46
Sirius would definitely be brighter than  Polaris. If we keep going Venus, a planet now,
7:54
that we're speaking of, has a magnitude of  -4. So that tells us Venus is  
7:58
really bright in the sky. I can always tell  where Venus is because it is the brightest  
8:04
object in the sky next to the Sun.  The Sun has a magnitude of -27.  
8:11
That seems counter-intuitive, right? That  negative means it would wouldn't be as bright,  
8:16
but remember it's that inverse scale. So if we take  a look at a star map here. We're going back to Vega. 
8:22
Vega is the brightest star in the constellation of  Lyra and you can see the magnitude scale down here. 
8:30
We defined that Vega was 0  magnitude and you can see its size  
8:35
matches that magnitude. That's how it works. Okay, we know there are some limitations of this. 
Limitations of the Magnitude System
8:42
Some of the limitations include human eyes. They  are more sensitive to red and yellow light than  
8:48
blue light. As you can see I did color this blue  but it doesn't stand out as much as red and yellow.
8:55
Also, photographic film is tends to be  more sensitive to blue light. As you can see  
9:01
in this example. Another limitation is that  visual magnitude versus photographic magnitude  
9:09
will definitely be different. We are limited  by our human eyes and we can capture things  
9:14
on photographs that we wouldn't be able to see  otherwise. Apparent magnitude can also be  
9:20
influenced by atmospheric disturbances. So you can  see this if you look at stars that are right up  
9:25
along the horizon. What you see is this kind of  twinkling going on and that's really the gas is  
9:32
moving in the air that causes that twinkling and  it's usually more pronounced along the horizon.  
9:37
Also, the scale is in reverse so that can  make it confusing as well. If we wanted to  
9:43
see what's what is like the absolute greatest or- I shouldn't say absolute that might be the wrong  
9:50
choice of words- but how far can we see out  there with the instruments we do have today. 
How far the Hubble SpaceTelescope see?
9:55
So I found this picture and I find it interesting  because it shows you the naked eye limit which  
10:00
is magnitude of 6. Notice we're talking of  apparent magnitude. The Hubble Space Telescope  
10:06
sees a little more than 25, in between  25 and 30 apparent magnitude. So what's  
10:12
going to be exciting is once the James  Webb Space Telescope launches that will  
10:20
definitely be a more powerful instrument than the  Hubble Space Telescope. We are probably going to  
10:25
see things of even fainter magnitude. What's  interesting is that that the James Webb also has  
10:33
an infrared camera, so we're  gonna be looking at this through a different lens.
10:38
So that's my video explanation of magnitude.  I do hope this is helpful for you as you're  
10:46
looking at different star maps. Now you  also know the difference between apparent  
10:51
versus absolute magnitude. Thank you so  much for watching! Remember it takes time,  
10:56
patience and practice to really identify the  stars. I wish you clear skies and keep looking up!
