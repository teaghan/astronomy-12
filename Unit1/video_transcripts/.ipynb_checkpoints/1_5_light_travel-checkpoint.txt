Intro
0:00
In life, we're used to looking at everything around us unfolding in real time.
0:04
But looking up at the night sky is different.
0:07
When we look at the stars we're actually looking at the past, we aren't seeing the stars, or
0:12
really anything in the universe as they currently are.
0:15
We're seeing them as they were.
0:17
This all comes down to the way that light travels through space.
0:21
Understanding space-time and why light moves the way it does means that one day we could
0:26
look so far into the cosmos, we could be able to see the very first light at the birth of
0:31
the universe, nearly 13.8 billion years ago.
0:35
And, in fact, there are astronomers and cosmologists working on this right now.
Speed of Light
0:41
The most important point you need to remember is that light travels at a constant speed,
0:46
which means that it takes time to get anywhere.
0:49
So if you look up the Big Dipper.
0:50
The stars are anywhere from 79 to 125 light years away.
0:55
That means that what you're seeing is really the light that left the star 79 or more years
0:59
ago, when you look up and see the moon, that's what it looked like 1.3 seconds ago.
1:04
Same idea with planets, and it works in reverse too, if you looked at Earth through a super
1:10
powerful telescope, from a galaxy 65 million light years away, you would see the earth
1:15
as it was 65 million years ago, or around the time that T rex went extinct.
Ancient Calculations
1:21
Thinking about the speed of light isn't a new concept, there's some evidence that scholars in 14th
1:27
century India were exploring the speed of sunlight.
1:30
They thought of light as a sort of wind, and though they couldn't prove anything concretely,
1:34
when converted into modern units, ancient calculations came surprisingly close to the
1:39
actual speed of light.
1:41
Today, we've calculated that speed down to the nanosecond. Light speed applies here on
1:46
earth too just in much smaller distances.
1:50
If you look at an object one meter away from you, you're not seeing it as it was
1:55
three billionths of a second ago.
1:57
This might seem too small to even matter.
2:00
After all, it's impossible for us to discern three billionths of a second.
2:04
But when we talk about space, those distances are so immense that the speed of light creates
2:09
huge gaps in observational time.
2:12
So what does this mean for astronomers making observations of the stars?
2:16
Well, it makes things a lot more complicated, especially since the universe is expanding
2:22
the stretching of the fabric of the universe ever outward affects the light traveling through
2:26
it.
2:27
Another way I like to say this is that the light sticks to the fabric of space-time as
2:31
the fabric of the universe expands, so to the waves of light.
The Doppler Effect
2:35
This is what's known as the Doppler effect.
2:38
It's the same reason why ambulance sirens seem to get higher and pitch, as it passes
2:42
you. The waves are getting shortened, and then stretched out again.
2:46
With light, it's the color of each wavelength changes as the object gets farther away, and the light waves
2:52
are more stretched out.
2:53
This is what's known as redshift. Red because the longer the wavelength, the more red the
2:58
light appears.
2:59
At some point the waves get so long, they no longer appear as visible light, and slip
3:04
into infrared. Redshift isn't something you can see with the naked eye, as it only applies
3:08
for objects that are really far away, and the change in hue is very slight.
Redshift
3:12
So, if you want to look at anything, really, really far away into the universe, you would
3:16
need to account for the redshift.
3:18
This is why the Hubble Space Telescope, was built to see a small portion of the infrared
3:23
spectrum.
3:24
In 2016, Hubble observed a galaxy 32 billion light years away, but since this galaxy is
3:30
so far away and the universe has been stretching since the light first left it,
3:35
we're really looking at the galaxy as it was 13.4 billion years ago, I know.
3:39
Leave it to the universe to make things more complicated.
3:43
This is the closest we've come to observing the birth of the universe, this galaxy GNZ-11
Telescopes
3:48
is located near Ursa Major, but even if you squint as hard as you can, you still won't
3:54
be able to see it, unless of course you have some seriously impressive infrared super vision.
3:59
Oh, and you'd have to be floating above Earth, because our atmosphere blocks some of the
4:03
infrared.
4:04
Now, telescopes are getting even better, so much so that they may one day, even be able
4:09
to see the beginning of the universe.
4:11
Thinking about the beginning of the universe as we know it.
4:15
We're thinking of stars and galaxies, and that's a little bit later in the universe.
4:19
Not very much though.
4:21
And so, to see that, we actually might have a chance with these future telescopes
4:26
and we might be able to see the supernovae of the first stars, we might be
4:30
able to find the first galaxies ever.
4:32
Astrophysicist Taylor Hutchison studies distant galaxies, close to the time of the Big Bang.
4:39
The galaxies I look at are some of the most distant galaxies we've ever
4:42
found so far, and the galaxies we're seeing existed about a billion years after
4:46
the Big Bang.
4:48
So to kind of translate that that's about 13 billion years ago from our present day.
4:54
And in order to observe these galaxies, accounting for redshift is super important.
4:59
Light is all getting stretched and shifted to longer and longer wavelengths.
5:02
So, because that's such a vast distance the light we see from these galaxies from the ultraviolet
5:08
is actually in the near infrared, which is hard to see, That means that you need telescopes,
5:14
and instruments that are sensitive to that and working from the ground is really hard
5:18
in the near-infrared, then you need a space telescope.
5:21
So we're really always pushing the limitations of what the current technology can give us.
5:25
The James Webb Space Telescope is going to be a serious game changer for these kinds
5:30
of observations, because it will observe from outside Earth's atmosphere and specialize
5:35
partly in the infrared.
5:37
While we wait for these findings about the early universe, remember that every time you
5:40
look at the stars, you're seeing back in time, and looking up at Ursa Major you can imagine
5:46
how the Earth would look in reverse.. Pretty incredible right?
5:49
Thank you so much for watching this video.
5:51
I know that the more I learned about astronomy, the more questions I have, so please let us
5:56
know what else you'd like us to cover down in the comments.
