0:10
to understand the idea of the celestial
0:12
sphere first think of the Earth in
0:15
space the stars all around us look as if
0:19
they could be on the inside of a huge
0:20
distance
0:21
sphere though the stars are really at
0:24
different distances this idea of the
0:27
celestial sphere is very useful for
0:29
giving positions in the sky now imagine
0:31
you are close to the North Pole here it
0:35
is like being on a roundabout because
0:37
the Earth is spinning on its axis once a
0:40
day every day each star circles all
0:43
around you and around the point overhead
0:46
which is the celestial North
0:49
Pole there is of course a Celestial
0:52
South Pole as well and the celestial
0:54
equator circles the sky halfway between
0:57
the
0:58
poles
1:00
positions on the celestial sphere are
1:02
specified by two coordinates declination
1:06
like latitude on Earth is measured in
1:08
degrees north or south of the
1:10
Equator positive declinations are North
1:14
negative declinations
1:17
South right Ascension the equivalent of
1:20
longitude is measured in hours from a
1:23
zero line an hour is
1:28
15Â° because you are on the Earth's
1:30
surface half of the sky is completely
1:33
hidden the Earth gets in the way and
1:36
creates Your Horizon in effect your
1:40
personal sky is like a hemispherical
1:44
dome imagine now you move to the earth's
1:48
equator the celestial equator runs from
1:50
east to west through the Zenith the
1:53
overhead point the celestial poles are
1:56
due north and south on the horizon the
2:00
north south line on the sky through the
2:02
Zenith is called the
2:05
Meridian at an intermediate latitude the
2:09
altitude of the celestial pole in the
2:11
sky is equal to your latitude on Earth
2:14
some stars are circumpolar and never
2:18
set it's sometimes useful to know a
2:21
star's altitude its height above the
2:23
Horizon and its azoth its Compass
2:27
direction azoth is measured round the
2:29
Horizon from North but as the stars move
2:33
their altitude and azoth constantly
