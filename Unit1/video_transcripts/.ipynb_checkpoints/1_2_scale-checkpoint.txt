In the winter of 1995,
0:08
scientists pointed the Hubble Telescope at an area of the sky near the Big Dipper,
0:15
a spot that was dark and out of the way of light pollution from surrounding stars.
0:21
The location was apparently empty, and the whole endeavor was risky.
0:25
What, if anything, was going to show up?
0:29
Over ten consecutive days,
0:30
the telescope took close to 150 hours of exposure of that same area.
0:36
And what came back was nothing short of spectacular:
0:40
an image of over 1,500 distinct galaxies
0:44
glimmering in a tiny sliver of the universe.
0:49
Now, let's take a step back to understand the scale of this image.
0:53
If you were to take a ballpoint pen
0:54
and hold it at arm's length in front of the night sky,
0:58
focusing on its very tip,
1:00
that is what the Hubble Telescope captured in its first Deep Field image.
1:07
In other words,
1:08
those 3,000 galaxies were seen in just a tiny speck of the universe,
1:13
approximately one two-millionth of the night sky.
1:17
To put all this in perspective,
1:18
the average human measures about 1.7 meters.
1:22
With Earth's diameter at 12,700 kilometers,
1:26
that's nearly 7.5 million humans lined up head to toe.
1:31
The Apollo 8 astronauts flew a distance of 380,000 kilometers to the moon.
1:37
And our relatively small Sun has a diameter of about 1.4 million kilometers,
1:43
or 110 times the Earth's diameter.
1:46
A step further,
1:48
the Milky Way holds somewhere between 100 to 400 billion stars,
1:52
including our Sun.
1:54
And each glowing dot of a galaxy captured in the Deep Field image
1:59
contains billions of stars at the very least.
2:03
Almost a decade after taking the Deep Field image,
2:06
scientists adjusted the optics on the Hubble Telescope
2:09
and took another long exposure over a period of about four months.
2:14
This time, they observed 10,000 galaxies.
2:17
Half of these galaxies have since been analyzed more clearly
2:22
in what's known as the eXtreme Deep Field image,
2:25
or XDF.
2:27
By combining over ten years of photographs,
2:30
the XDF shows galaxies so distant
2:32
that they're only one ten-billionth the brightness
2:36
that the human eye can perceive.
2:39
So, what can we learn about the universe from the Deep Field images?
2:43
In a study of the universe, space and time are inextricably linked.
2:47
That's because of the finite speed of light.
2:50
So the Deep Field images are like time machines to the ancient universe.
2:55
They reach so far into space and time
2:57
that we can observe galaxies that existed over 13 billion years ago.
3:03
This means we're looking at the universe as it was
3:05
less than a billion years after the Big Bang,
3:09
and it allows scientists to research galaxies in their infancy.
3:13
The Deep Field images have also shown that the universe is homogeneous.
3:17
That is, images taken at different spots in the sky look similar.
3:22
That's incredible when we think about how vast the universe is.
3:25
Why would we expect it to be the same across such huge distances?
3:30
On the scale of a galaxy, let alone the universe,
3:33
we're smaller than we can readily comprehend,
3:36
but we do have the capacity to wonder,
3:38
to question,
3:39
to explore,
3:40
to investigate,
3:41
and to imagine.
3:42
So the next time you stand gazing up at the night sky,
3:45
take a moment to think about the enormity of what is beyond your vision,
3:49
out in the dark spaces between the stars.
