Introduction
0:03
Hello, and welcome to Crash Course Astronomy! I’m your host, Phil Plait, and I’ll be
0:06
taking you on a guided tour of the entire Universe. You might want to pack a lunch.
0:21
Over the course of this series we’ll explore planets, stars, black holes, galaxies, subatomic
0:27
particles, and even the eventual fate of the Universe itself.
0:31
But before we step into space, let’s take a step back. I wanna talk to you about science.
0:36
There are lots of definitions of science, but I’ll say that it’s a body of knowledge,
0:40
and a method of how we learned that knowledge.
0:42
Science tells us that stuff we know may not be perfectly known; it may be partly or entirely
0:47
wrong. We need to watch the Universe, see how it behaves, make guesses about why it’s
0:53
doing what it’s doing, and then try to think of ways to support or disprove those ideas.
0:57
That last part is important. Science must be, above all else, honest if we really want
1:03
to get to the bottom of things.
1:05
Understanding that our understanding might be wrong is essential, and trying to figure
1:09
out the ways we may be mistaken is the only way that science can help us find our way
1:14
to the truth, or at least the nearest approximation to it.
1:17
Science learns. We meander a bit as we use it, but in the long run we get ever closer
1:23
to understanding reality, and that is the strength of science. And it’s all around us!
1:28
Whether you know it or not, you’re soaking in science.
1:31
You’re a primate. You have mass. Mitochondria
1:34
in your cells are generating energy. Presumably, you’re breathing oxygen.
1:38
But astronomy is different. It’s still science, of course, but astronomy puts you in your place.
1:43
Because of astronomy, I know we’re standing on a sphere of mostly molten rock and metal
1:48
13,000 kilometers across, with a fuzzy atmosphere about 100 km high, surrounded by a magnetic
1:54
field that protects us from the onslaught of subatomic particles from the Sun 150 million
2:00
km away, which is also flooding space with light that reaches across space, to illuminate
2:05
the planets, asteroids, dust, and comets, racing out past the Kuiper Belt, through the
2:10
Oort Cloud, into interstellar space, past the nearest stars, which orbit along with
2:14
gas clouds and dust lanes in a gigantic spiral galaxy we call the Milky Way that has a supermassive
2:20
black hole in its center, and is surrounded by 150 globular clusters and a halo of dark
2:25
matter and dwarf galaxies, some of which it’s eating, all of which can be seen by other
2:29
galaxies in our Local Group like Andromeda and Triangulum, and our group is on the outskirts
2:34
of the Virgo galaxy cluster, which is part of the Virgo supercluster, which is just one
2:38
of many other gigantic structures that stretch most of the way across the visible Universe,
2:43
which is 90-billion light years across and expanding every day, even faster today than
2:48
yesterday due to mysterious dark energy, and even all that might be part of an infinitely
2:53
larger multiverse that extends forever both in time and space.
2:57
See? Astronomy puts you in your place.
What is Astronomy?
3:00
But what exactly is astronomy? This isn’t necessarily an obvious thing to ask. When
3:04
I was a kid, it was easy: Astronomy is the study of things in the sky. The sun, moon,
3:10
stars, galaxies, and stuff like that. But it’s not so easy to pigeonhole these days.
3:15
Take, for example, Mars. When I haul my ‘scope out to the end of my driveway and look at
3:20
Mars, that’s astronomy, right? Of course! But what about the rovers there? Those machines
3:25
aren’t doing astronomy, surely. They’re doing chemistry, geology, hydrology, petrology…
3:30
everything but astronomy!
3:32
So nowadays, what’s astronomy? I’d say it’s still studying stuff in the sky, but
3:36
it’s branched out quite a bit from there. Borders between it and other fields of science
3:41
are fuzzy… a theme I’ll be hitting on several times over this series. Humans might
3:45
like firm, delineated boundaries between things, but nature isn’t so picky.
3:49
And that brings us to our first edition of “Focus On…”
Who Studies Astronomy?
3:52
This week’s topic: Astronomers! Who are we? What do we do?
3:55
I used to look through telescopes for a living, or at least study the data that came from
3:59
detectors strapped onto them. But now I talk and write (and make videos) about astronomy,
4:05
and relegate my viewing to my personal backyard telescope. But I still consider myself an
4:10
astronomer, so that should give you an idea that there’s a lot of wiggle room in the profession.
4:14
In fact, when I worked on Hubble Space Telescope, I was actually hired as... a programmer!
4:19
I coded in the language used by the folks helping to build and calibrate a camera that
4:24
was due to launch into space and be installed onto Hubble by an astronaut.
4:27
Once the data from that camera are taken and analyzed, you have to know what to do with
4:31
them. Do the observations fit the physical model of how stars blow up, or how galaxies
4:36
form, or the way gas flows through space? Well, you better know your math and physics,
4:40
because that’s how we test our hypotheses. And someone who does that is generally called
4:45
an astrophysicist.
4:46
Of course, those telescopes and detectors don’t create themselves. We need engineers
4:50
to design and build them and technicians to use them.
4:53
Most astronomers don’t actually use the telescopes themselves anymore; someone who’s
4:57
trained in their specific use does that for them.
5:00
Some of those instruments go into space, and some go to other worlds, like the moon and Mars.
5:05
We need astronomers and engineers and software programmers who can build those, too.
5:09
And then, at the end of all this, we need people to tell you all about it. Teachers,
5:14
professors, writers, video makers, even artists.
5:16
So I’ll tell you what: If you have an interest in the Universe, if you love to look up at
5:21
the stars, if you crave to understand what’s going on literally over your head, then who
5:26
am I to say you’re not an astronomer?
Origins of Astronomy
5:27
However you define astronomy, humans have been looking up at the sky for as long as
5:31
we’ve been humans. Certainly ancient people noticed the big glowy
5:35
ball in the sky, and how it lit everything up while it was up, and how it got dark when
5:39
it was gone. The other, fainter glowy thing tried, but wasn’t quite as good as lighting
5:44
up the night. They probably took that sort of thing pretty seriously. They probably also
5:48
noticed that when certain stars appeared in the sky, the weather started getting warmer
5:52
and the days longer, and when other stars were seen, the weather would get colder and
5:57
daytime shorten.
5:58
And when humans settled down, discovered agriculture, and started farming, noticing those patterns
6:03
in the sky would have had an even greater impact. It told them when to plant seeds,
6:07
and when to harvest.
6:08
The cycles in the sky became pretty important. So important that it wasn’t hard to imagine
6:13
gods up there, looking down on us weak and ridiculous humans, interfering with our lives.
6:18
Surely if the stars tell us when to plant, and control the weather, seasons, and the
Astrology vs Astronomy
6:22
length of the day, they control our lives too… and astrology was born.
6:27
Astrology literally means “study of the stars”; as a word it’s been used before
6:32
science became a formal method of studying nature. It irks me a bit, since it got the
6:37
good name, and now we’re stuck with “astronomy,” which means “law or culture of the stars."
6:42
That’s not really what we do! But what the heck. Words change meaning over time, and
6:47
now it’s pretty well understood that astronomy is science, and astrology… isn’t.
6:53
Millennia ago, astrology was as close to science as you got. It had some of the flavors of
6:58
science: astrologers observed the skies, made predictions about how it would affect people,
7:03
and then those people would provide evidence for it by swearing up and down it worked.
7:07
The thing is, it really didn’t; the fault of astrology lies in ourselves and not our
7:13
stars. People tend to remember the hits and forget the misses when predictions are made,
7:17
which is why they sometimes sit in casinos pumping nickels into machines that are in
7:22
proven to be nothing more than a method for reducing the number of nickels you have.
7:26
But astrology led to people to really study the sky, and find the patterns there, which
7:31
led to a more rigorous understanding of how things worked in the heavenly vault.
7:35
It wasn’t overnight, of course. This took centuries. Before the invention of the telescope,
7:40
keen observers built all sorts of odd and wonderful devices to measure the heavens,
7:45
and in fact it was before the telescope was first turned to the sky that a huge revolution
7:50
in astronomy took place.
Geocentrism
7:51
It is patently obvious that the ground you stand on is fixed, rooted if you will, and
7:57
the skies turn above us. The sun rises, the sun sets. The moon rises and sets, the stars
8:03
themselves wheel around the sky at night. Clearly, the Earth is motionless, and the
8:08
sky is what is actually moving. In fact, if you think about it, geocentrism
8:12
makes perfect sense that all the objects in the sky revolve about the Earth, and are fixed
8:17
to a series of nested spheres, some of which are transparent, maybe made of crystal, which
8:22
spin once per day. The stars may just be holes in the otherwise opaque sphere, letting sunlight though.
8:28
Sounds silly to you, doesn’t it?
8:30
Well, here’s the thing: If you don’t have today’s modern understanding of how the
8:34
cosmos works, this whole multiple-shells-of-things-in- the-sky thing actually does make sense. It explains
8:41
a lot of what’s going on over your head, and if it was good enough for Plato, Aristotle,
8:45
and Ptolemy, then by god it was good enough for you. And speaking of which, it was endorsed
8:50
by the major religions of the time, so maybe it’s better if you just nod and agree and
8:55
don’t think about it too hard.
8:56
But a few centuries ago things changed. Although he wasn’t the first, the Polish mathematician
Revolutions in Astronomy
9:01
and astronomer Copernicus came up with the idea that the sun was the center of the solar
9:06
system, not the Earth. His ideas had problems, which we’ll get to in a later episode, but
9:11
it did an incrementally better job than geocentrism.
9:14
And then along came Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler, who modified that system, making it
9:19
even better. Then Isaac Newton - oh, Newton - he invented calculus partly to help him
9:26
understand the way objects moved in space. Over time, our math got better, our physics
9:31
got better, and our understanding grew. Applied math was a revolution in astronomy, and then
9:37
the use of telescopes was another. Galileo didn’t invent the telescope, by
9:40
the way, but made them better; Newton invented a new kind that was even better than that,
9:46
and we’ve run with the idea from there.
9:47
Then, about a century or so ago, came another revolution: photography. We could capture
9:53
much fainter objects on glass plates sprayed with light-sensitive chemicals, which revealed
9:58
stars otherwise invisible to us, details in galaxies, beautiful clouds of gas and dust in space.
10:04
And then in the latter half of the last century, digital detectors were invented, which were
10:09
even more sensitive than film. We could use computers to directly analyze observations,
10:14
and our knowledge leaped again. When these were coupled with telescopes sent in orbit
10:19
around the Earth - where our roiling and boiling atmosphere doesn’t blur out observations
10:23
- we began yet another revolution.
Astronomy Today
10:26
And where are we now?
10:27
We’ve come such a long way! What questions can we routinely ask that our ancestors would
10:32
not have dared, what statements made with a pretty good degree of certainty?
10:36
Think on this: The lights in the sky are stars! There are other worlds. We take the idea of
10:43
looking for life on alien planets seriously, and spend billions of dollars doing it. Our
10:48
galaxy is one of a hundred billion others. We can only directly see 4% of the Universe.
10:55
Stars explode, and when they do they create the stuff of life: the iron in our blood,
11:00
the calcium in our bones, the phosphorus that is the backbone of our DNA. The most common
11:06
kind of star in the Universe is so faint you can’t see it without a telescope. Our solar
11:10
system is filled to overflowing with worlds more bizarre than we could have dreamed.
11:16
Nature has more imagination than we do. It comes up with some nutty stuff. We’re clever
11:21
too, we big-brained apes. We’ve learned a lot… but there’s still a long way to go.
11:26
So, with that, I think we’re ready. Let’s explore the universe.
Review
11:29
Today you learned what astronomy is, and that astronomers aren’t just people who operate
11:33
telescopes, but include mathematicians, engineers, technicians, programmers, and even artists.
11:39
We also wrapped up with a quick history of the origins and development of astronomy,
11:43
from ancient observers to the Hubble Space Telescope.
