    "## 1.3 The Celestial Sphere\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever wondered why the stars seem to move across the sky each night, or why certain constellations are only visible during specific times of the year? To ancient astronomers, the heavens appeared as a vast, rotating dome with the Earth at its center. This imaginary dome, or celestial sphere, is a concept that has helped astronomers understand and describe the positions and movements of celestial objects for centuries. Today, we'll explore the celestial sphere and discover its significance in modern astronomy.\n",

    "  <p>Watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Toya19H12w\" target=\"_blank\">this video</a> to see a detailed explanation of the celestial sphere and the motion of the stars.</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "### The Celestial Sphere\n",
    "\n",
    "The celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere of arbitrarily large radius, centered on the Earth, on which all celestial objects can be considered to lie. Although this concept is a simplification, it remains incredibly useful for locating stars, planets, and other celestial bodies in the sky.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Tip:</b> Think of the celestial sphere as a giant globe surrounding the Earth, with stars projected onto its inner surface.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of the celestial sphere include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Zenith**: The point directly overhead.\n",
    "- **Horizon**: The line where the sky appears to meet the Earth.\n",
    "- **Celestial Poles**: Extensions of Earth's North and South Poles onto the celestial sphere.\n",
    "- **Celestial Equator**: The projection of Earth's equator onto the celestial sphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Celestial Poles and Celestial Equator\n",
    "\n",
    "The celestial poles are the points around which the sky appears to rotate. The North Celestial Pole is currently near the star Polaris, making it a valuable navigation aid. The celestial equator is a great circle on the celestial sphere, midway between the celestial poles.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The celestial equator divides the sky into the northern and southern celestial hemispheres, similar to how Earth's equator divides our planet.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Rising and Setting of the Sun\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sun, Moon, and stars appear to rise in the east and set in the west due to Earth's rotation. This daily movement, known as diurnal motion, is one of the most familiar astronomical phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Ecliptic**: The apparent path of the Sun across the celestial sphere over the course of a year. This path is inclined to the celestial equator due to the tilt of Earth's axis, leading to seasonal changes.\n",

    "### Fixed and Wandering Stars\n",
    "\n",
    "Ancient astronomers categorized celestial objects into \"fixed stars\" and \"wandering stars.\" Fixed stars maintain fixed patterns relative to each other and form constellations. Wandering stars, known today as planets, move relative to the fixed stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The planet Mars can be seen moving against the backdrop of fixed stars over several nights, unlike stars that maintain their relative positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constellations\n",
    "\n",
    "Constellations are patterns of stars that have been identified and named by various cultures throughout history. Today, astronomers recognize 88 constellations that divide the sky into sectors, making it easier to locate celestial objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Did You Know?** The modern meaning of a constellation includes not just the pattern of stars but also the region of the sky around it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teaghan/astronomy-12/main/Unit1/figures/Figure2_8.png\" alt=\"Orion and other constellations\" width=\"1000\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n",

    "### Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define the main features of the celestial sphere.\n",
    "- Explain the system astronomers use to describe the sky.\n",
    "- Describe how the motions of the stars appear to us on Earth.\n",
    "- Describe how the motions of the Sun, Moon, and planets appear to us on Earth.\n",
    "- Understand the modern meaning of the term constellation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Check Your Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What are the celestial poles and how do they relate to Earth's poles?**\n",
    "2. **Explain why the Sun appears to move along the ecliptic.**\n",
    "3. **Differentiate between fixed stars and wandering stars.**\n",
    "4. **What is the significance of the celestial equator?**\n",
    "5. **Describe the modern meaning of a constellation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed information, refer to Section 2.1 of the \"Astronomy\" textbook. Work through the examples and calculations to deepen your understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The celestial sphere is a foundational concept in astronomy, helping us navigate the night sky and understand the apparent motions of celestial objects. By mastering this concept, you'll gain a deeper appreciation for the beauty and complexity of the universe.\n",
