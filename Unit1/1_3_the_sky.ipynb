    "# 1.3 The Celestial Sphere\n",

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever wondered why the stars seem to move across the sky each night, or why certain constellations are only visible during specific times of the year? To ancient astronomers, the heavens appeared as a vast, rotating dome with the Earth at its center. This imaginary dome, or *celestial sphere*, is a concept that has helped astronomers understand and describe the positions and movements of celestial objects for centuries. Today, we'll explore the celestial sphere and discover its significance in modern astronomy.\n",

    "### The Celestial Sphere\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine lying back on a clear night, gazing up at the stars. It feels as if you are inside a gigantic, hollow dome with the stars stuck onto its inner surface. This is the celestial sphere, an imaginary sphere of arbitrarily large radius, centered on the Earth, on which all celestial objects can be considered to lie. Although the celestial sphere is a simplification, it remains incredibly useful for locating stars, planets, and other celestial bodies in the sky.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Tip:</b> Think of the celestial sphere as a giant globe surrounding the Earth, with stars projected onto its inner surface.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of the celestial sphere include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Zenith**: The point directly overhead.\n",
    "- **Horizon**: The line where the sky appears to meet the Earth.\n",
    "- **Celestial Poles**: Extensions of Earth's North and South Poles onto the celestial sphere.\n",
    "- **Celestial Equator**: The projection of Earth's equator onto the celestial sphere.\n",

    "### Celestial Poles and Celestial Equator\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the celestial sphere, imagine extending Earth's axis points into the sky. The points where this line intersects the celestial sphere are the north celestial pole and the south celestial pole. As Earth rotates about its axis, the sky appears to turn in the opposite direction around these celestial poles.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The celestial equator divides the sky into the northern and southern celestial hemispheres, similar to how Earth's equator divides our planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you stood at the North Pole, you would see the north celestial pole overhead at your zenith. The celestial equator would lie along your horizon. As you watch the stars during the course of the night, they would all circle around the celestial pole, with none rising or setting. Conversely, at the equator, you would see the celestial equator pass overhead through your zenith, and the celestial poles at the north and south points on your horizon.\n",

    "### Rising and Setting of the Sun\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sun, Moon, and stars appear to rise in the east and set in the west due to Earth's rotation. This daily movement, known as diurnal motion, is one of the most familiar astronomical phenomena. The path the Sun appears to take across the celestial sphere over the course of a year is called the ecliptic. This path is inclined to the celestial equator due to the tilt of Earth's axis, leading to seasonal changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Imagine standing in San Francisco, where the latitude is 38째 N. The north celestial pole would be 38째 above the northern horizon. As Earth turns, the whole sky seems to pivot about the north celestial pole. Stars within 38째 of the North Pole never set, while stars within 38째 of the south celestial pole never rise.\n",

    "### Fixed and Wandering Stars\n",
    "\n",
    "Ancient astronomers categorized celestial objects into \"fixed stars\" and \"wandering stars.\" Fixed stars maintain fixed patterns relative to each other and form constellations. Wandering stars, known today as planets, move relative to the fixed stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fixed stars include most of the stars we see in the night sky. They form patterns that have been recognized and named as constellations. These patterns appear to move across the sky in a predictable way each night and throughout the year, making them useful for navigation and timekeeping.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The ancient Greeks called the planets \"asteres planetai,\" which means \"wandering stars.\" Unlike the fixed stars, the planets change their positions relative to the background stars over days, weeks, and months.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constellations\n",
    "\n",
    "Constellations are patterns of stars that have been identified and named by various cultures throughout history. Today, astronomers recognize 88 constellations that divide the sky into sectors, making it easier to locate celestial objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modern constellations are used not only to identify patterns of stars but also to define specific areas of the sky. Each constellation covers a region of the celestial sphere, so every point in the sky belongs to one of the 88 constellations. This system helps astronomers communicate about locations in the sky with precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Did You Know?** The modern meaning of a constellation includes not just the pattern of stars but also the region of the sky around it. For example, the constellation Orion is not just the familiar hunter figure but also the area of the sky where this pattern is found.\n",

    "\n",
    "6. Suppose you are on a strange planet and observe, at night, that the stars do not rise and set, but circle parallel to the horizon. Next, you walk in a constant direction for 8000 miles, and at your new location on the planet, you find that all stars rise straight up in the east and set straight down in the west, perpendicular to the horizon. How could you determine the circumference of the planet without any further observations? What is the circumference, in miles, of the planet?\n",
