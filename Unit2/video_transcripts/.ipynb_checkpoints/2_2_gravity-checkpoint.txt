Professor Dave here, I want to tell you
0:02
about Newton's law of universal gravitation.
0:11
We learned about Newton's
0:12
laws of motion, but there's one more law
0:15
of his to discuss, and it's a big one.
0:16
It's Newton's law of universal
0:19
gravitation. In possibly one of the
0:21
greatest strokes of genius in the
0:23
history of mankind, Newton looked at the
0:26
motion of the planets in their nearly
0:28
circular orbits around the Sun and
0:30
understood that the centripetal force
0:32
causing this motion was precisely the
0:35
same force that causes objects to fall
0:37
down towards Earth, which we call the
0:40
gravitational force. In this way he
0:43
proposed that the planets are in a kind
0:45
of free fall towards the Sun just the
0:47
same way that the Apple that mythically
0:49
hit him on the head to produce this
0:51
insight was in free fall towards the
0:53
earth. The objects differ greatly in size
0:57
but the concept is the same. Newton
1:00
corroborated this notion with a thought
1:02
experiment. When a cannon fires a cannon ball,
1:05
the ball eventually hits the ground.
1:07
If another cannonball is fired with
1:10
greater force, it will go a little
1:13
further before hitting the ground. If a
1:15
cannonball could be fired with an
1:17
incredibly immense force, it could
1:20
produce a speed so great that the ball
1:22
would never hit the ground, since it
1:24
would fall at the same rate that Earth's
1:27
curvature is produced. It would thus
1:29
always be falling towards the earth but
1:32
never hitting it. Such an object would be
1:34
said to be in orbit around the Earth.
1:37
Of course no cannon can do this, but we have
1:40
finally achieved this feat with all of
1:42
our satellites and space stations, which
1:44
are brought up to orbit on rockets .These
1:47
are very far from Earth's surface and
1:49
they are moving with such great speed
1:51
that they, along with anyone on board, are
1:54
always falling towards the earth but
1:56
never hitting it, in a free fall just
1:59
like Newton's apple. This means they
2:02
orbit around the Earth indefinitely at a
2:04
fixed speed and radius. The same can be
2:07
said for all the planets around the Sun.
2:09
This gravitational force can describe
2:12
the motion of every object
2:13
in space and it is the case that every
2:16
object that contains mass will exert
2:18
gravity on every other massive object.
2:21
Of course to feel the effects of gravity we
2:23
must be near an enormous object, like a
2:25
planet, but it is completely accurate to
2:28
say that gravitational force is exerted
2:30
by your car, your refrigerator, even you
2:33
yourself. It is just that this force is
2:35
completely negligible compared to the
2:37
gravitational force exerted by the earth.
2:40
Newton developed an equation to quantify
2:43
the magnitude of the gravitational force
2:45
between two objects, and it looks like
2:47
this, where F is equal to the constant of
2:50
universal gravitation, G, times the mass
2:53
of the first object, times the mass of
2:55
the second object, divided by the
2:57
distance between them squared. This
2:59
constant, like any other constant, simply
3:01
exists so that a natural phenomenon like
3:03
gravity can be expressed in our own
3:05
arbitrary man-made units, and it is equal
3:08
to 6.67 times 10 to the negative 11
3:10
Newton meters squared over kilogram
3:13
squared. These are the units that will
3:15
cancel out the units on the masses and
3:17
radius so as to give a value for force
3:20
in newtons. This value is not known to
3:23
Newton at the time but was determined
3:26
experimentally about a hundred years
3:27
later by Henry Cavendish. When discussing
3:30
the radius between two objects we will
3:32
take the distance between their centers
3:34
rather than their surfaces, as Newton
3:37
showed that the gravitational force
3:39
exerted by an object depends only on its
3:42
mass and not on its volume, meaning that
3:45
when discussing gravity we can treat
3:47
everything as a point like mass. He had
3:50
to invent the calculus to do so, much to
3:53
the dismay of math students everywhere.
3:55
When examining a system like the earth
3:58
and the moon, we must understand that
4:01
both of these objects exert
4:02
gravitational force on the other, and
4:04
that these forces are equal in magnitude
4:06
meaning that both of these bodies rotate
4:09
around their combined center of mass, but
4:12
don't forget that F equals ma, so equal
4:15
forces will not produce equal
4:17
accelerations if the masses are
4:19
different. As it happens, the earth is
4:22
much much more massive than the moon so
4:24
the mutual gravitational force is able
4:26
to accelerate
4:27
the moon more than the earth, and the
4:29
center of mass for the system lies
4:32
within the earth itself, which is why we
4:34
simply observe the moon going around the
4:36
earth. The same can be said for Newton's
4:39
falling apple. The apple accelerates
4:42
towards the earth and the earth
4:43
accelerates towards the apple, but the
4:46
earth is more massive than the apple by
4:48
an inconceivable factor, so the
4:51
acceleration of the earth is not even
4:53
measurable whereas we can visually
4:55
confirm the acceleration of the apple.
4:57
Furthermore, we want to understand that
5:00
an apple will fall to the earth with the
5:02
same acceleration as a bowling ball or
5:04
any other massive object, if we disregard
5:07
wind resistance. Although
5:09
counterintuitive to some, we can
5:12
rationalize this if we understand that
5:14
while the force of gravity is able to
5:17
impart greater acceleration on a more
5:19
massive object, the more massive object
5:22
also has greater inertia or resistance
5:24
to being accelerated, so the end result
5:28
is that all objects accelerate towards
5:30
Earth in the same way, at 9.8 meters per
5:33
second squared. This fact is easy to
5:36
derive if we do some algebraic
5:37
manipulation. We know that a falling
5:40
object exhibits behavior according to
5:42
Newton's second law, F equals ma, where
5:45
the force that generates the falling is
5:47
equal to the mass of the object times
5:49
its acceleration, but this force is the
5:52
gravitational force, so we can also model
5:54
the falling behavior with G m1 m2 over r
5:57
squared, where m 1 is the mass of the
5:59
object and m2 is the mass of the earth.
6:01
If we set these equal to each other, the
6:04
mass of the object is found on both
6:06
sides and will cancel out, so we can see
6:09
that the acceleration due to gravity is
6:11
equal to the gravitational constant
6:12
times the mass of the Earth divided by
6:15
the radius squared. This means that the
6:17
mass of an object does not affect the
6:20
rate of free fall.
6:31
Newton's work on gravity
6:32
was revolutionary. It correlated an
6:34
incredible amount of data, from
6:36
terrestrial motion to celestial motion,
6:39
which is all any good theory can hope to
6:41
do. But he could not explain how objects
6:44
can exert the gravitational force on one
6:47
another from a distance. Later, scientists
6:49
solved this problem by labeling gravity
6:52
as a field force, stating that matter
6:54
generates gravitational fields in space.
6:56
This was a bit more satisfactory, but it
6:59
wasn't until Einstein's general theory
7:02
of relativity that we arrived at a more
7:04
sophisticated understanding of gravity,
7:06
which has helped us learn about the
7:08
structure of space itself, as well as how
7:11
planets and stars and galaxies form. We
7:14
are still trying to fully understand
7:15
gravity today, but the continuation of
7:18
this discussion will have to wait until
7:20
the modern physics course, so for now
7:22
let's check comprehension.
