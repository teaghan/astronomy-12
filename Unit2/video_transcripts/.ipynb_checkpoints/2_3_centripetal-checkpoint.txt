at first glance centripetal force looks
0:02
strange
0:03
consider this situation the moon
0:06
revolves around the earth
0:07
the moon has a velocity as shown at a
0:09
particular instant
0:11
however to make this circular motion the
0:13
force should be perpendicular to the
0:15
velocity
0:16
as shown
0:20
in mechanics we generally see velocity
0:22
in the direction of the applied force
0:26
why then is centripetal force
0:28
perpendicular to the velocity
0:30
what is centrifugal force let's figure
0:33
it out with an interesting thought
0:34
experiment
0:36
consider this tennis ball
0:40
and assume it's moving on a straight
0:41
line initially
0:43
if you apply force perpendicular to its
0:45
motion for a short time
0:47
the object will deflect as shown its
0:50
direction changes
0:52
now let's apply the force again
0:53
perpendicular to the new direction
0:55
the object deflects again let's repeat
0:58
this process
1:02
now observe the shape the object
1:04
traveled
1:06
it's very close to a circle
1:13
if the time interval of applied force is
1:15
significantly smaller
1:16
you will get a more perfect circle
1:20
which means if an object is always acted
1:22
upon with a force
1:23
perpendicular to its velocity the object
1:25
will move in a circle
1:27
this force is known as centripetal force
1:37
one more logical conclusion would be
1:39
that more the centripetal force
1:41
more will the object's deflection or
1:43
lesser will be the radius of the circle
1:51
this means for any circular motion to
1:53
occur inward perpendicular force
1:56
must act upon the object
2:00
to get the value of the centripetal
2:01
force we should approach the problem
2:03
analytically
2:04
and start with the way sir isaac newton
2:06
defined force
2:08
however there's no fun in an analytical
2:10
derivation
2:11
so we'll animate this method the
2:13
conceptual understanding we already
2:15
developed will really help you in
2:16
science
2:17
and engineering
2:21
once again it is clear from this
2:22
equation that the lesser the radius of
2:24
the circle
2:25
the more centripetal force will be
2:27
needed
2:29
when the moon revolves around the earth
2:31
the gravitational force
2:32
acting between the moon and the earth
2:34
provides the necessary centripetal force
2:38
similarly when you rotate an object
2:40
attached to a string
2:41
the tension in the string provides the
2:43
required centripetal force
2:46
consider this spinning wooden block the
2:48
frictional force between
2:50
the block and floor lends the necessary
2:52
centripetal force
2:54
in short centripetal force should be
2:56
supplied by some external source such as
2:58
gravitation
2:59
tension friction etc
3:03
now that we've learned the concept of
3:04
centripetal force the big question is
3:07
what is centrifugal force consider these
3:10
examples
3:12
when fluid spins in a beaker as the
3:14
speed of the beaker increases
3:16
the fluid flows outward
3:19
similarly in this centrifugal casting
3:21
process
3:22
the molten metal always moves to the
3:24
outer wall
3:26
as you increase the speed of this
3:27
suspended ball the ball
3:29
also travels outward
3:32
is there any force called the
3:34
centrifugal force which is acting
3:36
radially outward on a rotating object to
3:38
move it outward
3:41
scientifically speaking there is no such
3:43
force as a centrifugal force
3:46
it's a pseudo force a rotating object
3:49
always needs a force which is radially
3:51
inward
3:52
centrifugal force is needed in physics
3:54
only when you analyze the problem
3:56
rotating along with the object
3:59
in this example since the observer is
4:01
sitting inside a rotating cabin
4:03
the observer has to add a centrifugal
4:05
force to analyze the problem
4:07
it's a pseudo force added to convert a
4:09
non-inertial frame of reference
4:11
to an inertial frame of reference
4:14
if the observer is on the ground there
4:16
is no need to use such a force
4:20
now let's analyze the previous examples
4:22
using the concept of centripetal force
4:24
we have developed
4:26
as you rotate the ball faster it moves
4:28
away
4:30
the ball needs a centripetal force the
4:33
tension of the rope more specifically
4:35
the horizontal component of its tension
4:37
provides that force the tension on the
4:40
ball has
4:40
one more responsibility the vertical
4:43
component of the tension
4:44
has to balance the weight of the ball
4:48
logically as the ball rotates faster the
4:50
rope's tension
4:51
should increase to supply the sufficient
4:53
centripetal force
4:56
however the weight of the ball does not
4:58
increase which means that in order to
5:00
keep the vertical component of the
5:01
tension the same
5:03
the angle has to increase like this
5:09
this is the reason why the ball moves
5:11
away as you rotate it faster
5:18
the case of the rotating fluid is
5:20
slightly different
5:23
here again each fluid particle requires
5:25
a particular amount of centripetal force
5:28
to maintain the circular motion
5:31
the pressure difference caused by the
5:32
water level's height disparity
5:34
generates that centripetal force the
5:37
fluid
5:38
particles at the outer radius obviously
5:40
need more centripetal force
5:42
to satisfy this increasing centripetal
5:44
force requirement
5:45
the fluid surface has to form a curved
5:48
shape
5:48
rather than a straight line when the
5:51
water volume
5:52
rotates faster each particle demands
5:54
more centripetal force
5:56
or more pressure difference across the
5:58
particle
5:59
therefore the water surface curves more
6:01
than in the previous case
6:04
or you feel like the water is going
6:05
outward
6:07
it's better to avoid using centrifugal
6:09
force in your scientific or
6:11
engineering analyses because it's a
6:13
pseudo force
6:14
used only in some special cases always
6:17
work
6:17
using centripetal force that's the real
6:20
force that a rotating object requires
