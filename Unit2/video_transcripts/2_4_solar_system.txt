- [Narrator] Our solar system is one
0:04
of over 500 known solar systems
0:06
in the entire Milky Way galaxy.
0:10
The solar system came into being
0:11
about 4.5 billion years ago, when a cloud
0:15
of interstellar gas and dust collapsed,
0:17
resulting in a solar nebula, a swirling disc
0:20
of material that collided to form the solar system.
0:25
The solar system is located
0:27
in the Milky Way's Orion star cluster.
0:30
Only 15% of stars in the galaxy host planetary systems,
0:34
and one of those stars is our own sun.
0:40
Revolving around the sun are eight planets.
0:43
The planets are divided into two categories,
0:45
based on their composition,
0:47
Terrestrial and Jovian.
0:49
Terrestrial planets including Mercury, Venus, Earth,
0:52
and Mars, are primarily made of rocky material.
0:56
Their surfaces are solid, they don't have ring systems,
0:59
they have very few or no moons,
1:01
and they are relatively small.
1:05
The smallest and closest to the sun is Mercury,
1:08
which has the shortest orbit in the solar system
1:10
at about three Earth months.
1:13
Venus is the hottest planet, with temperatures
1:16
of up to 867 degrees Fahrenheit, due to an atmosphere
1:20
of carbon dioxide and extensive lava flows.
1:23
Next to this world of fire is a world of water, Earth.
1:28
The water systems on this planet help create
1:30
the only known environment in the universe
1:32
capable of sustaining life.
1:36
The last of the terrestrial planets, Mars,
1:38
might have also supported life about 3.7 billion years ago,
1:43
when the planet had a watery surface, and moist atmosphere.
1:48
Beyond the four Terrestrial planets
1:50
of the inner solar system lie the Jovian planets
1:53
of the outer solar system.
1:55
The Jovian planets include gas giants Jupiter and Saturn
1:58
and ice giants Uranus and Neptune.
2:01
The gas giants are predominantly made of helium
2:04
and hydrogen, and the ice giants also contain rock, ice,
2:08
and a liquid mixture of water, methane, and ammonia.
2:12
All four Jovian planets have multiple moons,
2:14
sport ring systems, have no solid surface, and are immense.
2:20
The largest Jovian is also the largest planet
2:23
in the solar system, Jupiter.
2:26
Nearby is Saturn, the solar system's second largest planet.
2:31
Its signature rings are wide enough
2:33
to fit between Earth and the moon,
2:35
but are barely a kilometer thick.
2:39
Past Saturn are the ice giants, Uranus and Neptune.
2:43
The slightly bigger of these ice giants, Uranus,
2:46
is famous for rotating on its side.
2:50
Next to Uranus is Neptune, the outermost planet
2:53
in the solar system, and also one of the coldest.
2:57
Orbiting the Terrestrial planets is the asteroid belt,
3:00
a flat disc of rocky objects, full of remnants
3:03
from the solar system's formation.
3:05
From microscopic dust particles,
3:07
to the largest known object, the dwarf planet, Ceres.
3:12
Another disc of space debris lies much further out,
3:15
and orbits the Jovian planets, the icy Kuiper Belt.
3:20
Apart from asteroids, the Kuiper Belt is also home
3:23
to dwarf planets, such as Pluto,
3:24
and is the birthplace of many comets.
3:27
Beyond the Kuiper Belt is the Oort Cloud,
3:30
a vast, spherical collection of icy debris.
3:33
It is considered the edge of the solar system
3:36
since that is where the gravitational
3:38
and physical influences of the sun end.
3:41
Our solar system's particular configuration
3:44
of planets and other celestial objects,
3:46
all revolving around a life-giving star,
3:49
make it a special place to call home.
