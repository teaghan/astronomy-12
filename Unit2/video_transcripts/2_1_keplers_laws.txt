hello learners this is easy engineering
0:12
today we are going to talk about another
0:14
fun topic in physics
0:16
it is all about the kepler's laws of
0:18
planetary emotion
0:20
kepler's laws of planetary motion are
0:23
laws
0:24
describing the motions of the planets in
0:26
the solar system
0:27
they were derived by the german
0:29
astronomer johannes kepler
0:31
there are three laws of planetary motion
0:33
let us talk about them one by one
0:37
kepler's first law of planetary motion
0:39
sometimes referred to as the loss of
0:42
ellipses can be stated as all planets
0:45
move about the sun in elliptical orbits
0:48
having the sun as one of the
0:51
foci this means that planets are
0:53
orbiting the sun in a path described as
0:55
an ellipse this is a picture of an
0:58
ellipse
1:01
suppose this ellipse is where the planet
1:03
earth moves
1:04
the earth moves along the ellipse around
1:06
the sun
1:08
the sun is located at either one or
1:09
foresight of the ellipse
1:13
now let us move on to the second law
1:16
kepler's second law of planetary motion
1:18
sometimes referred to as the law
1:20
of equal areas can be stated as
1:24
a radius vector joining in the planet to
1:26
the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal
1:28
lengths of time
1:30
the second law describes the speed at
1:32
which any given planet
1:34
will move while orbiting the sun know
1:37
that when a planet is close to the sun
1:39
it moves fast but when a planet is far
1:41
from the sun
1:42
it moves slowly so if we draw an
1:45
imaginary line of the movement of the
1:47
planet
1:47
and the sun for every month of the year
1:50
we can see that when the planet is close
1:52
to the sun
1:53
it will form a wide but short triangle
1:56
and when the planet is far from the sun
1:58
[Music]
2:01
it will form a thin but long triangle
2:05
the earth would have to adjust its
2:07
movements in order to match the
2:08
imaginary area
2:11
did you know that the knowledge of
2:12
kepler's second law has proved
2:14
the importance of newton's law of
2:16
gravitation
2:17
newton showed that the motion a body is
2:20
subject to central gravitational force
2:22
does not always follow the elliptical
2:24
orbits as specified with the first law
2:26
of kepler
2:27
but instead planets or other heavenly
2:30
bodies can take parts defined
2:32
by other open chronic herbs
2:35
amazing right now let us move on to the
2:38
kepler's planetary motion sometimes
2:40
referred to as the law of harmonies
2:43
can be stated as the squares of the
2:46
sidereal periods of the planets
2:48
are directly proportional to the cubes
2:50
of their mean distances from the sun
2:53
it compares the orbital period and
2:55
radius of orbit of the planet
2:57
to those of other planets it is the
2:59
ratio of the squares
3:00
of the periods to the cubes of their
3:02
average distances from
3:04
the sun is the same for every one of the
3:06
planets
3:07
the comparison of each planet can be
3:09
shown in this illustration
3:12
now what does that mean kepler's third
3:15
law means
3:16
how long a planet takes to go around the
3:18
sun which is its period
3:20
is related to the planet's mean distance
3:23
from the sun
3:25
that is the square of the period divided
3:28
by the cube of the mean distance
3:31
is equal to a constant and for every
3:33
planet no matter what is period or
3:35
distance
3:36
t squared over r cubed is the same
3:39
number
3:40
and that's it did you enjoy our topic
3:42
