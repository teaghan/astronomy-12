### 2.1 Keplerâ€™s Laws of Planetary Motion
   - Law of Orbits: All planets move in elliptical orbits, with the sun at one focus
   - Law of Areas: A line that connects a planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time
   - Law of Periods: The square of the period of any planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit

### 2.2 Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation
   - Definition and formula
   - Gravitational constant
   - Inverse square law

### 2.3 Circular Motion
   - Centripetal force
   - Examples of centripetal forces in daily life
   - Orbital speed

### 2.4 The Structure and Components of Our Solar System
   - Formation of the Solar System
   - Sun, planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dwarf planets

### 2.5 Planetary Motion
   - Newton's second law in circular motion
   - Simplified model: circular orbit with only central mass
   - Geostationary satellites
   - Tides and tidal forces
