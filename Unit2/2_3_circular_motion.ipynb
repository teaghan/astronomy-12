    "# 2.3 Circular Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Circular motion is a fundamental concept in astronomy, playing a crucial role in understanding the behavior of celestial bodies. When studying the orbits of planets around the Sun, moons around their planets, and artificial satellites around Earth, we observe that these objects follow curved paths. This motion is not only key to the structure of our solar system but also to the mechanics of many astronomical phenomena. In this lesson, we will delve into the principles of circular motion, examining its effects on the orbits of various celestial objects and the forces that maintain these orbits.\n",

    "## Uniform Circular Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniform circular motion occurs when an object moves along a circular path at a constant speed. Despite the constant speed, the object's velocity is continuously changing because its direction is always changing. This constant change in direction results in an acceleration towards the center of the circular path, known as centripetal acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics:**\n",
    "- **Constant Speed:** The magnitude of the velocity remains unchanged.\n",
    "- **Changing Direction:** The direction of the velocity vector changes continuously.\n",
    "- **Centripetal Acceleration:** The acceleration is directed towards the center of the circular path.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simple calculations regarding the orbits of planets, moons, satellites, and other celestial bodies, we can approximate these orbits by assuming they are in circular motion. This simplification allows us to use the principles of uniform circular motion to understand and predict their behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples in Astronomy:**\n",
    "- **Planets orbiting the Sun:** The gravitational pull of the Sun provides the necessary centripetal force.\n",
    "- **Moons orbiting planets:** Moons remain in orbit due to the gravitational pull of their parent planets.\n",
    "- **Satellites orbiting Earth:** Artificial satellites stay in orbit due to the Earth's gravitational force.\n",

    "## Centripetal Force\n",
    "\n",
    "Centripetal force is the force required to keep an object moving in a circular path, directed towards the center of the circle. This force is essential because it counters the object's inertia, which would otherwise cause it to move in a straight line. The word \"centripetal\" comes from Latin, meaning \"center-seeking,\" highlighting the force's direction toward the center of the circular path.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Centripetal force keeps an object moving in a circular path by constantly pulling it towards the center.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of circular motion, any force that keeps an object on its curved path acts as a centripetal force. This could be tension in a string for a ball being swung around, friction between tires and the road for a car turning a corner, or gravity for celestial bodies in orbit.\n",

    "where:\n",
    "- $ F_c $ is the centripetal force\n",
    "- $ m $ is the mass of the object\n",
    "- $ v $ is the velocity of the object\n",
    "- $ r $ is the radius of the circular path\n",

    "### Relation to Gravitational Force\n",
    "\n",
    "In astronomy, the most common centripetal force is gravity. For planetary motion, gravity provides the necessary centripetal force to keep a planet in orbit around the Sun. Similarly, gravity keeps moons orbiting their planets and artificial satellites orbiting the Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In orbital motion, the centripetal force is the force of gravity.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we look at the gravitational force acting as the centripetal force, the expressions can be equated:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F_g = F_c\n",

    "This leads to the equation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{GMm}{r^2} = \\frac{mv^2}{r}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Here, $ G $ is the gravitational constant and $ M $ is the mass of the central body (such as the Sun or Earth). Simplifying this equation allows us to understand the relationships between the various forces and motions involved in orbital mechanics.\n",

    "In this example, the immense centripetal force required to keep Earth in its orbit is provided by the gravitational pull of the Sun. This force constantly pulls Earth towards the Sun, balancing the inertia of Earth's motion, which attempts to move it in a straight line. This delicate balance is what maintains the stable orbit of our planet.\n",

    "## Orbital Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the speed at which an object orbits a celestial body is crucial in astronomy. The orbital speed determines how long it takes for an object, such as a planet, moon, or satellite, to complete one full orbit around its primary body.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining Newton's law of universal gravitation with the concept of centripetal force, we can derive the formula for orbital speed. This derivation provides insight into how gravitational forces and the mass of celestial bodies influence the motion of orbiting objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Derivation of Orbital Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "To derive the orbital speed, we start with the fact that the gravitational force ($F_g$) acting on an object in orbit provides the necessary centripetal force ($F_c$) to keep it in circular motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-Step Derivation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Equate Gravitational Force to Centripetal Force:**\n",
    "   $$ \n",
    "   F_g = F_c \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Express Gravitational Force:**\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   F_g = \\frac{GMm}{r^2}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   - Where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the central body, $m$ is the mass of the orbiting object, and $r$ is the radius of the orbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Express Centripetal Force:**\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   F_c = \\frac{mv^2}{r}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   - Where $v$ is the orbital speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Set the Expressions Equal to Each Other:**\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\frac{GMm}{r^2} = \\frac{mv^2}{r}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Simplify the Equation:**\n",
    "   - Cancel $m$ from both sides:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\frac{GM}{r^2} = \\frac{v^2}{r}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - Multiply both sides by $r$:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\frac{GM}{r} = v^2\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Solve for Orbital Speed ($v$):**\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   v = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula shows that the orbital speed of an object depends on the gravitational constant ($G$), the mass of the central body ($M$), and the radius of the orbit ($r$). \n",
