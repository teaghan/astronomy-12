    "## Formation of the Solar System\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a vast cloud of gas and dust floating in space, a remnant of ancient stellar explosions. About 4.5 billion years ago, this seemingly unremarkable cloud began to collapse under its own gravity. This was the solar nebula, and its collapse initiated the birth of our solar system.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teaghan/astronomy-12/main/Unit2/figures/nebula.png\" alt=\"Solar Nebula\" width=\"1000\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Role of Gravity and Circular Motion\n",
    "- **Gravity**: As the solar nebula collapsed, gravity pulled the gas and dust towards the center, creating a dense core that would become the Sun.\n",
    "- **Circular Motion**: Conservation of angular momentum caused the collapsing cloud to spin faster and flatten into a rotating disc. This rotating disc of gas and dust is known as the protoplanetary or circumstellar disc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formation of Planetesimals and Protoplanets\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the circumstellar disc, particles of dust and ice began to stick together through electrostatic forces, forming clumps called planetesimals. These planetesimals, ranging from meters to kilometers in size, acted as the building blocks of planets. Through the process of accretion, these planetesimals collided and stuck together, gradually growing larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Planetesimals**: Small bodies formed from dust and ice that collided and stuck together. Over time, these planetesimals grew through further collisions and accumulation of material.\n",
    "- **Protoplanets**: As planetesimals continued to collide and merge, they formed larger bodies known as protoplanets. These protoplanets, several hundred kilometers in diameter, had sufficient gravity to influence their surroundings and attract more material.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formation of Planets\n",
    "\n",
    "The protoplanets eventually grew into the planets we see today through continued accretion and collisions. The solar wind from the young Sun blew away much of the remaining gas in the disc, halting further growth of the gas giants but allowing the terrestrial planets to continue forming from rocky materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Terrestrial Planets**: Closer to the Sun, where temperatures were higher, protoplanets formed from rocky and metallic materials. These include Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.\n",
    "- **Gas Giants**: Further from the Sun, where temperatures were cooler, protoplanets could accumulate lighter gases like hydrogen and helium, forming the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn.\n",
    "- **Ice Giants**: In the outer regions of the disc, protoplanets formed from ices and gases, resulting in Uranus and Neptune, which have significant amounts of water, ammonia, and methane.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Interesting Fact:</b> Jupiter's strong gravity influenced the formation of other planets, preventing the formation of a planet in the asteroid belt and influencing the orbits of nearby protoplanets.\n",

    "## The Sun: The Central Star\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of our solar system lies the Sun, a G-type main-sequence star that accounts for more than 99% of the solar system's total mass. It is the source of energy that sustains life on Earth and drives the climate and weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of the Sun\n",
    "- **Core**: The innermost part where nuclear fusion occurs, converting hydrogen into helium and releasing immense amounts of energy.\n",
    "- **Radiative Zone**: Energy from the core travels outward by radiation.\n",
    "- **Convective Zone**: Energy is transported to the surface by convection currents.\n",
    "- **Photosphere**: The visible surface of the Sun, emitting the light we see.\n",
    "- **Chromosphere**: A layer above the photosphere, visible during solar eclipses as a reddish glow.\n",
    "- **Corona**: The Sun's outer atmosphere, extending millions of kilometers into space and visible during total solar eclipses.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Sun is primarily composed of hydrogen (about 74%) and helium (about 24%), with trace amounts of heavier elements. The nuclear fusion process in the core converts hydrogen into helium, releasing energy that radiates outward and eventually reaches Earth, sustaining life and driving our climate. We will study this process more in our unit on stars!\n",

    "## The Planets: Types and Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "The planets in our solar system are divided into two main categories: Terrestrial and Jovian, each with distinct characteristics and fascinating features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terrestrial Planets\n",
    "\n",
    "The inner solar system is home to the terrestrial planets, rocky worlds forged from the dense materials left behind in the protoplanetary disc. These planets, closest to the Sun, are primarily composed of rock and metal, featuring solid surfaces and a variety of geological landscapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mercury\n",
    "Mercury, the smallest and innermost planet, orbits the Sun at a breakneck speed. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury experiences extreme temperature variations. Daytime temperatures soar to scorching heights, while nighttime temperatures plummet to icy lows due to its thin atmosphere, which lacks the ability to retain heat. The surface of Mercury is heavily cratered, resembling our Moon, and its lack of significant atmosphere allows us to glimpse its ancient, unaltered landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Did You Know?</b> A day on Mercury (one full rotation) lasts 59 Earth days, while a year (one orbit around the Sun) takes just 88 Earth days.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teaghan/astronomy-12/main/Unit2/figures/Mercury_surface.png\" alt=\"Terrestrial Planets\" width=\"1000\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Venus\n",
    "Venus, often called Earth's \"sister planet\" due to its similar size and composition, presents a stark contrast in conditions. Shrouded in thick clouds of sulfuric acid, Venus has the hottest surface temperatures in the solar system, reaching up to 467 degrees Celsius (872 degrees Fahrenheit). This intense heat is the result of a runaway greenhouse effect, where a dense atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide traps solar radiation. The surface pressure on Venus is crushing, equivalent to being 900 meters underwater on Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Interesting Fact:</b> The rotation of Venus is unique—it spins in the opposite direction to most planets, and its rotation period is longer than its orbit around the Sun. A day on Venus lasts 243 Earth days, while a year takes 225 Earth days.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Earth\n",
    "Earth, our home planet, stands out as the only known world with liquid water on its surface and life in abundance. Earth’s diverse climate and geological features, including mountains, oceans, and forests, create a rich and dynamic environment. The presence of liquid water is crucial, supporting a biosphere teeming with life. Earth's atmosphere, composed of nitrogen, oxygen, and trace gases, provides the right conditions for life and shields the surface from harmful solar radiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mars\n",
    "Mars, known as the Red Planet due to its iron oxide-rich soil, has fascinated scientists and explorers for centuries. With surface features reminiscent of both Earth and the Moon, Mars hosts the largest volcano and canyon in the solar system—Olympus Mons and Valles Marineris, respectively. Mars has polar ice caps composed of frozen water and carbon dioxide. Evidence of ancient river valleys and lake beds suggests that liquid water once flowed on its surface, raising the possibility that Mars might have supported microbial life in the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Interesting Fact:</b> Mars' Olympus Mons is the tallest volcano in the solar system, standing nearly three times the height of Mount Everest.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jovian Planets\n",
    "\n",
    "As we venture further from the Sun, we encounter the majestic Jovian planets, also known as gas giants. These massive planets, composed primarily of hydrogen, helium, and other volatiles, present a stark contrast to the rocky terrestrial worlds. Their immense sizes and unique characteristics offer a fascinating glimpse into the outer reaches of our solar system.\n",

    "\n",
    " margin-right: auto;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Jupiter\n",
    "Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, is a colossal world with a diameter of about 11 times that of Earth. Its most famous feature is the Great Red Spot, a gigantic storm larger than Earth itself, which has been raging for centuries. Jupiter's atmosphere is a dynamic blend of hydrogen and helium, with swirling clouds of ammonia crystals and complex weather patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teaghan/astronomy-12/main/Unit2/figures/Jupiter.png\" alt=\"Jupiter\" width=\"1000\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupiter is also home to an impressive array of moons, with over 79 known satellites. The largest of these, Ganymede, is the largest moon in the solar system, even surpassing Mercury in size. Other notable moons include Europa, which may harbor a subsurface ocean, and Io, the most volcanically active body in the solar system.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Interesting Fact:</b> Jupiter has a strong magnetic field, about 20,000 times stronger than Earth's, which traps charged particles and creates intense radiation belts.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Saturn\n",
    "Saturn, the second-largest planet, is renowned for its stunning ring system, a collection of countless ice and rock particles that orbit the planet. These rings, which can be seen through a small telescope, vary in density and composition, creating a breathtaking spectacle. Saturn's atmosphere, like Jupiter's, is predominantly hydrogen and helium, with upper cloud layers of ammonia, methane, and water ice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Saturn's numerous moons, including Titan and Enceladus, add to its intrigue. Titan, the second-largest moon in the solar system, has a thick atmosphere and lakes of liquid methane, while Enceladus, with its geysers of water-ice, hints at the presence of a subsurface ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Did You Know?</b> Saturn's rings are incredibly thin, with an average thickness of only about 10 meters (33 feet), despite their vast horizontal expanse.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Uranus\n",
    "Uranus stands out with its extreme axial tilt of about 98 degrees, causing it to rotate on its side. This unique tilt leads to unusual seasonal variations, with each pole experiencing 42 years of continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness. Uranus is classified as an ice giant due to its composition, which includes water, ammonia, and methane ices, in addition to hydrogen and helium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uranus's faint ring system and 27 known moons, including Miranda and Ariel, offer further points of interest. Miranda, in particular, features one of the most varied terrains in the solar system, with massive canyons and patchwork regions suggesting a history of intense geological activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Interesting Fact:</b> Uranus was the first planet discovered with a telescope, by William Herschel in 1781.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Neptune\n",
    "Neptune, the farthest planet from the Sun, is a striking blue world due to the presence of methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light and reflects blue. Neptune is known for its supersonic winds, which can reach speeds of up to 2,100 kilometers per hour (1,300 miles per hour), the fastest in the solar system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neptune has a faint ring system and 14 known moons, with Triton being the most notable. Triton is unique for its retrograde orbit, meaning it orbits Neptune in the opposite direction of the planet's rotation. Triton also exhibits geysers of nitrogen gas, suggesting active geological processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Did You Know?</b> Triton is thought to be a captured Kuiper Belt object, which may explain its unusual orbit.\n",
