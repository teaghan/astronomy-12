    "# 2.4: The Structure and Components of Our Solar System\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will explore the fascinating structure and components of our solar system. This will include an examination of the formation of the solar system, the central role of the Sun, the various planets, and other smaller bodies that orbit within our celestial neighborhood. This topic ties in with our previous discussions on gravity, circular motion, Kepler's Laws, and Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, providing a deeper understanding of how these principles govern the dynamics of our solar system.\n",

    "### Formation of the Solar System\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a vast cloud of gas and dust floating in space, a remnant of ancient stellar explosions. About 4.5 billion years ago, this seemingly unremarkable cloud began to collapse under its own gravity. This was the solar nebula, and its collapse initiated the birth of our solar system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Role of Gravity and Circular Motion\n",
    "- **Gravity**: As the solar nebula collapsed, gravity pulled the gas and dust towards the center, creating a dense core that would become the Sun.\n",
    "- **Circular Motion**: Conservation of angular momentum caused the collapsing cloud to spin faster and flatten into a rotating disc. Within this disc, particles collided and stuck together, forming planetesimals. These planetesimals merged to become protoplanets, the building blocks of our planets.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Tip:</b> Remember that the conservation of angular momentum explains why the collapsing cloud spun faster and flattened into a disc.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "As the center of the nebula grew denser and hotter, nuclear fusion began, igniting our Sun. The remaining material in the disc coalesced into the planets, moons, asteroids, and comets that make up our solar system today.\n",

    "### The Sun: The Central Star\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of our solar system lies the Sun, a G-type main-sequence star that accounts for more than 99% of the solar system's total mass. It is the source of energy that sustains life on Earth and drives the climate and weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Structure of the Sun\n",
    "- **Core**: The innermost part where nuclear fusion occurs, converting hydrogen into helium and releasing immense amounts of energy.\n",
    "- **Radiative Zone**: Energy from the core travels outward by radiation.\n",
    "- **Convective Zone**: Energy is transported to the surface by convection currents.\n",
    "- **Photosphere**: The visible surface of the Sun, emitting the light we see.\n",
    "- **Chromosphere**: A layer above the photosphere, visible during solar eclipses as a reddish glow.\n",
    "- **Corona**: The Sun's outer atmosphere, extending millions of kilometers into space and visible during total solar eclipses.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Composition\n",
    "- The Sun is primarily composed of hydrogen (about 74%) and helium (about 24%), with trace amounts of heavier elements. The nuclear fusion process in the core converts hydrogen into helium, releasing energy that radiates outward and eventually reaches Earth, sustaining life and driving our climate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sun's immense gravitational pull keeps the planets in their orbits, and its energy output creates the dynamic environment of the solar system.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Terrestrial Planets\n",
    "- **Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars**\n",
    "  - These planets, closest to the Sun, are primarily composed of rocky material.\n",
    "  - **Mercury**: The smallest and closest planet to the Sun, with extreme temperature variations between day and night due to its thin atmosphere.\n",
    "  - **Venus**: Known as Earth's \"sister planet,\" Venus is shrouded in thick clouds of sulfuric acid and has the hottest surface temperatures in the solar system, caused by a runaway greenhouse effect.\n",
    "  - **Earth**: The only known planet with liquid water and life, Earth has a diverse climate and geological features that support a rich biosphere.\n",
    "  - **Mars**: Known as the Red Planet, Mars has surface features reminiscent of both Earth and the Moon, with the largest volcano and canyon in the solar system. Evidence suggests it had liquid water in the past, raising the possibility of ancient microbial life.\n",

    "\n",
    "**The Story of Pluto**\n",
    "Once considered the ninth planet, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). This decision was based on the fact that Pluto shares its orbit with other objects in the Kuiper Belt, a region beyond Neptune filled with icy bodies.\n",

    "Comets, often described as \"dirty snowballs,\" are icy bodies that provide valuable clues about the outer regions of the solar system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Structure and Components of Comets\n",
    "- **Nucleus**: The solid core composed of ice, dust, and organic compounds.\n",
    "- **Coma**: A glowing cloud of gas and dust that forms around the nucleus when a comet approaches the Sun.\n",
    "- **Tails**: Comets typically have two tails—an ion tail made of charged particles and a dust tail made of small solid particles. These tails always point away from the Sun due to the solar wind.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Kuiper Belt\n",
    "- Located beyond Neptune, the Kuiper Belt is a vast region filled with icy bodies and dwarf planets, including Pluto. It is also the source of short-period comets, which have orbits that bring them into the inner solar system at regular intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Famous Comets\n",
    "- **Halley's Comet**: Perhaps the most famous comet, Halley's Comet is visible from Earth approximately every 76 years. It was last seen in 1986 and will return in 2061.\n",
    "- **Comet Hale-Bopp**: One of the brightest comets of the 20th century, Hale-Bopp was visible to the naked eye for 18 months in 1996-1997.\n",

    "#### Hypothetical Cloud of Icy Bodies\n",
    "- Extending up to 100,000 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, the Oort Cloud is believed to be the source of long-period comets, which have orbits that take them far beyond the planets and into the distant reaches of the solar system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Its Role in the Solar System\n",
    "- The Oort Cloud marks the outer boundary of the Sun's gravitational influence and is considered the edge of the solar system. It serves as a reservoir of icy bodies that occasionally get nudged into the inner solar system, becoming visible comets.\n",
