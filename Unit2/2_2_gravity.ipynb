    "# 2.1 Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Topics to cover\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Historical Context and Development:**\n",
    "   - Isaac Newton's biography and his contributions to science.\n",
    "   - The historical development of gravitational theory.\n",
    "   - How Newton's ideas built upon those of previous scientists such as Galileo and Kepler.\n",
    "   - Newton's second law formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Conceptual Foundations:**\n",
    "   - Explanation of gravity as a universal force.\n",
    "   - The significance of Newton's realization that the same force that causes objects to fall on Earth also governs the motion of celestial bodies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mathematical Formulation:**\n",
    "   - Introduction to the inverse square law (similar to stellar Flux, which students have been introduced to in unit 1)\n",
    "   - The formula for gravitational force: $F = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$, where \\(F\\) is the gravitational force, \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant, \\(m_1\\) and \\(m_2\\) are the masses of two objects, and \\(r\\) is the distance between the centers of the two masses.\n",
    "   - Units and dimensions involved in the formula.\n",
    "   - Example problems and calculations to illustrate how the formula is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Gravitational Constant (G):**\n",
    "   - Explanation of the gravitational constant \\(G\\).\n",
    "   - Historical measurements and experiments, such as those by Henry Cavendish.\n",
    "   - The value of \\(G\\) and its units.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Applications and Implications:**\n",
    "   - Gravity on Earth: weight, free fall, and projectile motion.\n",
    "   - Orbital motion: how gravity keeps planets in orbit around the Sun and moons in orbit around planets.\n",
    "   - Tides: the gravitational interaction between Earth, the Moon, and the Sun.\n",
    "   - Escape velocity and its calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
