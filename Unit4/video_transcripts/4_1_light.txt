Hey it's professor Dave, let's learn about light.
0:09
Since we've been able to
0:10
look up at the Sun, we've been aware of
0:12
light. As darkness is one of very few
0:15
things that we instinctually fear, we
0:18
have always bestowed light with godlike
0:20
properties, but for all of antiquity we
Classical electromagnetism
0:23
had no idea what light really was.
0:25
Figures like Newton and Huygens worked
0:28
with light in the 17th century, but a
0:31
more sophisticated description of light
0:33
which we call classical electromagnetism
0:36
was developed largely by James Clerk
0:39
Maxwell in the 19th century. This theory
0:42
depicts light as a transverse wave
0:45
composed of oscillating electric and
0:47
magnetic fields which are at right
0:50
angles to each other, and perpendicular
0:52
to the direction that the wave moves.
0:55
We will learn more about these fields later.
Electromagnetic Spectrum
0:58
Just like the kinds of waves we have
1:00
previously discussed, electromagnetic
1:03
waves have amplitudes, wavelengths, and
1:06
frequencies, but instead of different
1:09
frequencies producing different pitches
1:12
like sound waves, different frequencies
1:15
of electromagnetic waves produce
1:17
different kinds of light. If the light is
1:20
visible, these frequencies will
1:22
correspond to different colors.
1:24
Frequencies greater than this will exist
1:27
as UV radiation, x-rays, or gamma rays, and
1:31
frequencies less than this qualify as
1:33
infrared radiation, microwaves, or radio
1:37
waves. All of these phenomena are
1:40
collectively referred to as
1:41
electromagnetic radiation, and they can
1:45
be found on the electromagnetic spectrum.
1:47
Here we can see all the wavelengths and
1:50
frequencies ranging from radio waves to
1:52
gamma rays, and we have found some
1:55
technological use for all of these in
1:57
modern society, even though they seem
1:59
dramatically different, some requiring
2:02
things like antennas or other equipment
2:05
to manipulate. All of them are
2:07
fundamentally the same thing as the
2:10
light you can see with your eyeballs,
2:11
they are just of different
2:13
wavelengths. All electromagnetic
Speed
2:16
radiation moves at the speed of light
2:18
which is about 300 million meters per
2:21
second in a vacuum, the fastest speed
2:23
possible in the universe. This is fast
Frequency
2:26
enough to get from here to the moon in
2:28
about a second, and since we know that
2:30
all waves move at a speed that is equal
2:33
to their wavelength times their
2:34
frequency, this product will be equal to
2:37
the speed of light for any type of
2:39
electromagnetic radiation. How is it that
Conclusion
2:42
electromagnetic radiation is produced?
2:46
To answer this question we have to learn
2:48
about electric fields which are coming
2:51
up soon, for now let's check comprehension.
