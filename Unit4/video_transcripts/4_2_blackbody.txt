hi and welcome to high school physics
0:01
explained and today I'm going to be
0:03
talking about the blackbody curve about
0:05
reen's law and in particular in the
0:07
context of studying stars in particular
0:10
so stay tuned
0:15
[Music]
0:18
so what you could see he is a
0:20
representation of a blackbody curve now
0:24
before we study the actual graph here we
0:27
need to quickly review what a blackbody
0:28
is now a blackbody is simply an object
0:32
that absorbs all the radiation that
0:34
falls on it Andrea mitts it in the form
0:36
of electromagnetic radiation
0:38
so in sense of stars stars are
0:41
generating energy by the way of fusion
0:43
within their core so the light you see
0:45
from stars is totally due to emission
0:47
there's no reflection going on so if we
0:50
look at the blackbody curve you will see
0:52
that has a very characteristic shape now
0:55
the blackbody curve actually represents
0:57
basically the intensity per wavelength
1:01
so in this particular image here we're
1:03
going to be looking at the Sun you see a
1:06
distribution of wavelengths and with
1:10
different intensities so on the y-axis
1:12
we have our spectral power density so
1:15
really it's just talking about the
1:16
intensity for every given wavelength and
1:18
on the x-axis you see the wavelength so
1:21
the star that we call our Sun in this
1:24
case is giving a very characteristic
1:26
curve or a blackbody curve now let's
1:29
explore the parts of this graph here so
1:32
we're gonna add our labels here and you
1:33
will see that what we have here is the
1:36
visible spectrum we have our infrared
1:38
range and obviously the further we go
1:40
away with the longer the wavelength and
1:42
at the other end you see the
1:43
ultraviolets
1:45
section now you'll see that there is
1:47
quite a significant drop-off in the
1:49
ultraviolet the section and that's not
1:51
saying that the Sun is not giving off
1:53
any ultraviolet radiation it is but in
1:56
terms of higher frequencies the amount
1:58
of radiation or the intensity of those
2:01
ultraviolet signal padule-- drops off
2:03
now the reason behind that I'm not
2:05
discussing in this video but I have a
2:08
video if you look on black bodies and
2:09
Max Planck and I'll put the link in the
2:12
description below then you can explore
2:15
that so looking at our Sun we'll see
2:18
that we have a lot of infrared radiation
2:20
but we certainly have a lot more
2:22
radiation in the visible spectrum
2:25
if you then
2:26
look at that visible spectrum although
2:29
that we have here a differing amounts
2:33
between our ultraviolet and our red
2:36
there is not a huge difference in terms
2:39
of the intensities of these wavelengths
2:41
so what we end up seeing is you can see
2:43
here this diagram at the top here is the
2:46
fact that we're going to see white
2:48
lights because we're getting equal
2:50
amounts of roughly speaking of the
2:52
wavelengths that are in the visible
2:54
spectrum but now let's have a look what
2:58
happens at the spectrum as I change the
3:00
temperature so I'm going to first lower
3:03
the temperature you'll see what happens
3:05
is we're going to get a drop of
3:07
intensity along all wavelengths but if
3:10
you look very carefully you'll find that
3:12
the peak actually drops oh let me take a
3:14
photo of roughly where the Sun is which
3:17
is this line and then I'm going to drop
3:18
to the radiation emitted by a light bulb
3:21
like so and I press a photo here and you
3:24
can see that there is now a significant
3:26
difference so we have a drop in
3:29
intensity for each of the wavelengths
3:30
but we also have a shift towards the
3:34
right in other words the intensity of
3:36
the wave like that is of a greatest
3:38
intensity is certainly moved towards the
3:40
longer end now the issue now here of
3:42
course is the scale so if I'm just
3:44
reduce our scale of the Y axis then
3:47
we're going to get a better
3:50
representation here you can an seem that
3:52
the sun's graph is off the scale here
3:54
and here we have infrared radiation
3:56
being the predominant form of energy and
3:59
if you know anything about light bulbs
4:01
at least your old-style incandescent
4:03
light bulbs they're about 95 percent
4:05
inefficient that is of a hundred percent
4:08
of all the energy they emit the majority
4:10
is in the infrared range that's because
4:12
light bulbs acting like a blackbody and
4:14
it's giving off yes light but much more
4:17
in the terms of the infrared
4:19
now let's against a change our scale and
4:22
we're going to zoom out a bit and we're
4:24
going to increase the temperature as we
4:26
go up and I'm going to take a few
4:28
snapshots of various energies as we go
4:31
up so here's a snapshot again and I'm
4:35
going to move my graph again and another
4:37
snapshot over here
4:39
if you look very carefully you'll find
4:42
that our Peaks went from here now to
4:44
here and now to here so in other words
4:46
as we get hotter and hotter the
4:48
wavelength with the greatest intensity
4:50
moved to way things that are shorter if
4:53
I turn this intensity on you'll see I
4:56
now have the area underneath the graph
4:58
so since the scale tells us the
5:01
intensity per given wavelength the total
5:03
area under the graph is the total
5:05
intensity of the light given off by the
5:09
star now what is intensity it's the
5:11
amount of power per unit area so in
5:14
other words the Sun gives off a constant
5:16
certain roughly constant value of energy
5:19
so therefore energy over time its power
5:21
but as we go further and further and
5:24
further away that power that energy is
5:26
spread over a much larger surface area
5:28
so the intensity which is the amount of
5:31
power per given area certainly changes
5:35
so I again yeah I would look look at my
5:38
video where I look at the relationship
5:40
of the inverse square law in terms of
5:43
intensity in distance and there you can
5:45
see where I talk about intensity in that
5:47
regard now what happens if we now get a
5:50
hotter star so again I'm gonna have to
5:53
change my scales here so now I have
5:56
changed my scales and I'm now going to
5:59
start that is significantly hotter so
6:02
we're going to jump ray up to closer and
6:05
closer and I'm gonna stop here cuz we're
6:06
gonna go about the graph here in this
6:08
case we have a star that has a
6:09
temperature of around surface
6:11
temperature at least of around
6:12
8250 Kelvin you see again that the total
6:15
intensity certainly is greater so a hot
6:18
blue star is significantly brighter it
6:22
has a greater intensity then let's say
6:24
warmer let's say cooler stars such as
6:27
our Sun and even cooler star such as red
6:30
dwarfs and so forth but you again can
6:32
see that the peak has moved more and
6:35
more towards the left so if I now turn
6:38
on our graph values you can see here the
6:41
value of our wavelength and our
6:44
intensity are given so as I drop the
6:48
temperatures you'll see that as I move
6:50
across that both scales
6:53
so that is the peak intensity shifts and
6:57
so as I move that across like so you
7:02
will see that that almost looks like an
7:05
inverse relationship and it is an
7:08
inverse relationship and we'll discuss
7:10
that in a second now here we have of
7:13
course a representation of our star that
7:15
is significant Halloween au have a lot
7:17
of energy in the short wavelengths of
7:20
our visible and of course ultraviolet
7:22
and so as a result we see more blues and
7:25
less reds and greens and so we therefore
7:28
have blue star if I go to the other
7:31
extreme where we go to the red dwarf
7:34
which is a temperature of maybe around
7:36
3000 Kelvin like so my scale is way out
7:39
so I'm going to change that scale so
7:41
that we can get a better perspective and
7:44
there it is you can see we have lots of
7:47
infrared radiation we have a lot of in
7:50
terms of the visible there red end of
7:52
the spectrum but very little in the blue
7:54
end of the spectrum and so the star
7:55
appears a reddish color and so we refer
7:58
to often this as a red dwarf and the
8:00
intensity a total intensity of course is
8:03
significantly lower than the Sun and
8:05
even more significant than the hot blue
8:08
stars such as Sirius
8:09
all right so now let's again scale back
8:13
and now let's have a look a little bit
8:14
of mathematics which is probably one of
8:16
the reasons why you're watching this
8:17
video you understand blackbody curves
8:19
but you're also piqued by the term of
8:22
dean's law and now what is the Wenzel
8:24
there let's remind ourselves who's the
8:26
Dean his name is vilem Dean a German
8:29
scientists in the 19th century and he
8:31
was the first to really establish the
8:34
relationship between the wavelength that
8:36
is of the greatest intensity with the
8:38
temperature and that's the key so again
8:41
we're going to actually have our values
8:44
showing here and I'm going to get my
8:47
temperature increasing so as my
8:49
temperatures increase you will notice
8:51
that the wavelengths are decreasing of
8:54
that particular peak intensity and
8:57
therefore what we have here is an
9:00
inverse relationship between the
9:02
wavelength that is its peak value with
9:05
the temperature
9:07
so in other words why this is useful is
9:09
is that if you can work out the in
9:11
maximum wavelength intensity in other
9:14
words this particular value right here
9:16
then you can use this relationship which
9:19
we refer to as Venus law to determine
9:22
the temperature of the star so let's
9:25
have a look at this so it's an inverse
9:26
relationship so we know that the
9:28
temperature is proportional to 1 over
9:32
the wavelength or we can write at there
9:34
this way that the wavelength is
9:36
proportional to 1 over the temperature
9:38
so that's the inverse relationship so
9:41
what we will get if we were to graph the
9:44
wavelength with the temperature when you
9:46
would get an inverse relationship like
9:48
so but if we now graph the wavelength
9:53
with 1 over the temperature because
9:56
there's an inverse relationship we get a
9:58
straight line and that tells us that the
10:02
slope that is the wavelength divided by
10:04
1 over T is a constant value I'm gonna
10:09
call that constant value B at this point
10:11
now that means if I rearrange that I get
10:14
the wavelength is equal to B over T and
10:22
there is means law now B ends up being
10:29
equal to approximately 2 point 9 8 by 10
10:34
to the power of negative 3 so that's
10:37
Vain's law Vin's law is the relationship
10:41
between the wavelength that has the
10:44
greatest intensity and the temperature
10:46
in terms of Kelvin and it's a simple
10:48
inverse relationship where the constant
10:51
has the value of 2 point 9 8 by 10 to
10:54
the negative 3 now sometimes ravines law
10:56
is called Wiens displacement law this is
10:58
basically the same thing so when you
11:00
look it up and you see displacement law
