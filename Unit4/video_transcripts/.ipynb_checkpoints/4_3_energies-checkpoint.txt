0:00
so the photoelectric effect proves that
0:03
one electron can absorb one Photon of
0:06
energy the energy of a photon I'm going
0:09
to put e gamma gamma is the general
0:12
symbol for a photon doesn't necessarily
0:14
mean a gamma Photon Photon energy equals
0:18
HF F being frequency and H being planked
0:23
constant that's
0:26
6.63 * 10us 34 dual seconds now in the
0:31
photo electric effect we had electrons
0:33
in metals absorbing photons but it
0:36
doesn't have to be a metal it can be any
0:39
electron so I'm going to draw an atom
0:42
here I'm going to draw the nucleus which
0:43
is
0:44
positive then I'm going to
0:47
draw just one
0:51
electron in a shell around the nucleus
0:55
now when a photon comes
0:58
in and it's absorbed by an electron one
1:01
of two things can happen if it gets more
1:05
energy then the electron becomes more
1:09
excited and it
1:13
jumps to a shell that is further away
1:17
from the nucleus we can say that it's
1:19
gone up an energy
1:23
level and we call this
1:26
excitation photon is absorbed electron
1:29
go goes up an energy level now what
1:34
we're going to find out a little bit
1:35
later on is that electrons can only be
1:37
in certain energy levels another thing
1:39
can happen as well
1:45
though if the photon has Lads of
1:49
energy so it's got a higher frequency
1:52
then the electron has way too much
1:54
energy to go to the next energy level or
1:57
an energy level above that it actually
1:59
just completely
2:00
completely moves away from the atom what
2:04
are we left with we're left with an ion
2:07
this is ionization ionization is what
2:09
happens when an electron is given enough
2:11
energy by a photon or it can be given
2:14
energy by another free electron and it
2:17
jumps out of the atom completely and
2:20
we're left with a free electron and an
2:22
ion left obviously more energy is needed
2:25
for ionization than excitation now this
2:28
electron here doesn't like being in the
2:30
energy level above where it's supposed
2:32
to be usually so after it's absorbed the
2:35
energy and gone up it will come straight
2:37
back down when this electron does go
2:39
back to its normal energy level energy
2:42
is released and we call this de
2:44
exitation sometimes also called
2:48
relaxation the electron returns to
2:51
energy level and a
2:55
photon is
2:57
emitted so with the excitation of phot
2:59
phon can come in be absorbed by an
3:01
electron it can go up an energy level
3:03
come straight back down and by doing so
3:06
it releases its own Photon so let's draw
Energy levels
3:10
our atom again now this is where our
3:12
electron usually is but it could also be
3:15
if it has enough energy in any of these
3:18
shells or energy
3:20
levels above but they are very specific
3:24
to an
3:25
atom what we're going to do is take a
3:28
snapshot of this which just going to
3:30
take a slice of this and we're going to
3:31
blow it up here so instead of drawing
3:34
shells we're actually just going to draw
3:37
our energy levels like this so here's
3:40
our electron in its normal shell we're
3:44
going to call this its ground state
3:46
that's when it has no energy or rather
3:49
no more energy than usual it's all
3:51
relative now we're going to measure
3:53
these in electron volts now remember
3:56
that one electron volt is equals to 1.6
4:00
6 * 10 -9
4:03
Jew it's just an easier number to deal
4:05
with because when we're talking about
4:07
individual electrons energies we're
4:09
talking very small numbers of Jews so we
4:11
deal with electron volts instead now
4:14
when a photon comes
4:16
in the electron can jump to one of these
4:20
energy levels now I can tell you that
4:22
these energy levels here are five
4:24
electron volts seven electron volts and
4:27
eight electron volts this electron volts
4:30
here though once it reaches this point
4:33
it's out of the atom so that's when it's
4:37
actually being
4:39
ionized so if this Photon and the energy
4:42
of this photon is HF PL constant times
4:44
the frequency if the photon had eight
4:47
electron volts that's eight lots of
4:48
these or more to give the electron then
4:51
the electron would jump all the way up
4:52
past this eight electron volts and it
4:54
would escape the atom the atom is now
4:56
being ionized but we're not going to
4:58
think about that for now we're just
4:59
going to think about what would happen
5:01
if it didn't go quite to that point if
5:04
the energy of the photon was equals to
5:07
three electron volts it's not enough
5:10
energy to get the electron to its next
5:13
energy level so it's not like the photon
5:15
is absorbed and the electron goes
5:16
partway to this five electron volts it
5:18
can't do that instead the photon would
5:21
just pass straight
5:23
through so that means that it's not
5:28
absorbed but but if it did have exactly
5:31
let's say seven electron volts it's
5:34
enough to get it to its third energy
5:37
level we give these by the way numbers
5:40
N1 is the ground state then N2 then N3
5:44
so here we go the electron has absorbed
Emission
5:47
the
5:48
photon and it goes up to this energy
5:51
level here hrah it's absorbed a photon
5:54
of the right amount of energy cuz it has
5:56
just the right frequency and it's gone
5:58
up to that third energy level we said
6:01
that electrons like being at their
6:03
ground state they want to come back to
6:04
here as soon as possible now on the way
6:07
back down from here the electron now has
6:10
a choice either it can go straight back
6:13
down to
6:16
here and it can release a photon because
6:19
it has to get rid of
6:21
energy and that's going to be a photon
6:25
that has seven electron volts of energy
6:27
that makes sense but it has another
6:29
option as well so it can go from
6:33
n 3 to N1 or it can stop
6:37
halfway it can go to
6:40
here and then down to here so it's gone
6:43
from Nal
6:45
3 to n =
6:47
2 to Nal 1 so it's gone from the third
6:50
energy level to the second and then back
6:52
to the ground state there both of these
6:55
will release photons what's the energy
6:58
of this Photon going to be well it's
7:00
gone from Seven electron volts to five
7:02
electron volts so this photon is going
7:04
to have two electron volts of energy so
7:07
it's going to be 3.2 * 10- 19 Jew this
7:10
one here is going to release a photon
7:13
that has five electron volts of energy
7:16
so it's going to be 8 * 10 -9 Jew so
7:19
when an electron absorbs some energy
7:21
from a photon it only absorbs one Photon
7:25
but on its way down it has choices it
7:27
can go straight to the bottom or it can
7:30
go to energy levels in between then fall
7:33
to the bottom from there even though
7:35
we're absorbing one Photon here one type
7:38
of photon how many photons can be
7:40
emitted 1 2 3 so we're going to have
7:44
various colors of photons and light
7:47
being emitted when this electron goes
7:50
from the third energy level down to its
7:52
ground state what about if I wanted to
7:54
find out the wavelength of this Photon
7:58
here let's let's have a look we know
8:00
that the energy of a
8:02
photon is equals to
8:04
HF from the wave equation we know the V
8:08
or C is f Lambda frequency times
8:11
wavelength so that means that
8:13
frequency is equals to speed of light
8:16
divided by the wavelength pop this in
8:20
here we end up with energy equals
8:24
HC over Lambda rearrange this and we end
8:28
up with wavelength equals PL constant
8:31
times the speed of light divided the
8:33
energy of the photon give that a go if
8:35
you want pause the video if you feel
8:37
like
8:39
it this is going to be 6.63 * 10-
8:43
34 * 3 * 10 8 divided by well it's five
8:49
electron volts that's five times this
8:52
many Jews whenever we do any
8:54
calculations we always have to use
8:55
Jewels we never put electron volts
8:58
straight into into an equation that's
9:00
going to give us a wavelength of
9:04
2.5 * 10 - 7 m or about
9:09
250 nanm pretty much visible light so
Absorption & emission spectra
9:13
that does mean the atoms only absorb
9:17
certain wavelengths of light so you
9:20
might see a diagram like
9:23
this and you'll
9:26
see all the colors in the rainbow going
9:28
from
9:30
red all the way to
9:33
Blue and because we know that electrons
9:36
can only absorb certain wavelengths and
9:38
certain frequencies of
9:41
photons we get these black lines
9:44
appearing on
9:45
here and it's going to be different for
9:48
every single atom and molecule in the
9:50
world so this is an absorption Spectrum
9:53
so in other words all of these
9:55
wavelengths pass through but these black
9:58
lines show
9:59
the ones that are
10:01
absorbed so you can deduce energy levels
10:04
from those we also have an emission
10:06
spectrum as well other way around this
10:09
time the whole thing will be black apart
10:12
from a few colored
10:14
lines that
10:17
show what
10:23
frequencies and wavelengths are emitted
10:26
from something I've drawn an absorption
10:28
spectrum and emission spectrum for two
10:30
different elements here but if we did
10:32
have an absorption spectrum and an
10:33
emission spectrum would they be exactly
10:35
the same well no they wouldn't be you
10:38
would expect more lines on the emission
10:41
spectrum why is that well it's
10:45
because all electrons when they absorb
10:47
they have to start at the ground
10:51
state and go up to a specific energy
10:53
level on the way back down though they
10:56
can take any route they want so there's
10:59
always going to be a greater number of
11:01
different wavelengths that can be
11:02
emitted that could be absorbed you take
11:04
multiple Roots back to the ground
11:11
state one place that we see excitation
Fluorescent tube light
11:14
and de exitation
11:16
happening is in a fluorescent tube what
11:19
we have in here is low pressure Mercury
11:22
gas and what we do is we
11:25
fire
11:27
electrons from one end to the
11:30
other the electrons collide with the
11:34
Mercury atoms and they
11:37
excite the
11:41
electrons like we saw
11:46
earlier or we could draw it like
11:51
this the electrons de exite the problem
11:54
is is that they
11:56
emit UV photons
12:00
it's a high
12:02
frequency what do these photons
12:08
do these UV photons are absorbed by the
12:12
coating on the outside of the tube so
12:15
you have this
12:16
coating it's all around the outside if
12:18
it wasn't for this coating if you scrape
12:20
off the coating off a fluorescent tube
12:22
you're just getting UV photons coming
12:24
straight out but if we have this coating
12:25
the UV photons are absorbed by the
12:27
coating and have excitation again what
12:31
do they do in turn when they de exite
12:34
they emit visible photons therefore
12:37
lighting up a room that they're
12:51
in so that's how a fluorescent tube
12:54
Works notice that the excitation that we
12:57
get to begin with isn't due to the
12:59
absorption of photons it's an electron
13:02
coming in whacking into another electron
13:06
that electron goes off CU it's still got
13:07
loads of energy but it's given some of
13:10
its energy to this electron raising it
13:12
an energy level to get rid of that
13:14
energy it releases this high frequency
13:16
UV Photon that's absorbed by the coating
13:19
that then releases visible light photons
13:22
to light up a room so that's electron
13:24
energy levels if you think I've missed
