0:00
At first glance, this single bright source,
0:03
this smudge,
0:06
this grouping doesn't look like much.
0:11
Images like these are translated for our eyes, and it's because our eyes
0:15
only can perceive a small region of all the frequencies of light.
0:21
Astrophysics is much
0:22
more than just capturing different wavelengths of light.
0:25
Many objects or phenomenon are simply too
0:28
far away to directly image.
0:31
A lot of data comes from pixel
0:33
sized point sources, and those points provide astrophysicists
0:37
with a powerful window into what makes up the universe.
0:43
Even now,
0:44
most of what scientists learn about the cosmos
0:47
comes from studying light.
0:49
Astronomers can work out distances,
0:52
speed sizes, temperatures and the composition of elements
0:57
because matter behaves in predictable and consistent ways.
1:03
They do this by literally prying these photons apart.
1:07
This is spectroscopy, explained
1:12
spectroscopy.
1:13
It's a study of how matter interacts with light, and all began
1:18
with a prism like this one
1:22
light entering one side of the prism bends or refracts
1:25
as it passes through the triangle shape and exits out the other side.
1:31
All of the wavelengths enter together,
1:33
but they exist as a rainbow like spread of colors.
1:38
What's happening is that the shorter,
1:40
more energetic wavelengths like blue and violet
1:43
bend a little more than the longer lower energy light like red and orange,
1:49
because they bend at slightly different angles.
1:52
The wavelengths separate, fanning out into a band of colors.
1:58
NASA has a whole fleet of telescopes that can split and study
2:02
a wide range of light on the electromagnetic spectrum,
2:05
not just the light that our eyes can detect.
2:09
So Hubble can detect through the visible spectrum,
2:12
but also a bit into the infrared and the ultraviolet.
2:17
Webb is just infrared and can look at the light
2:20
that is emitted from billions of years ago.
2:23
And of course, the images from Webb are really spectacular.
2:27
But this is what flutters the hearts of scientists.
2:33
This spectrum shows the light that penetrated the atmosphere
2:36
of a planet called WASP 96 B.
2:40
The light being measured comes from the planet's host star,
2:43
some of which skims through the atmosphere.
2:48
Humans are a long way from directly imaging exoplanets,
2:52
so telescopes like Webb will use spectroscopy
2:54
to find those chemicals that could support life in their atmospheres,
2:58
which is why Webb's first spectra is so amazing.
3:04
You're actually seeing bumps and wiggles that indicate the presence
3:07
of water vapor in the atmosphere of this exoplanet.
3:10
Incredible.
3:12
But it's one thing to identify single elements or simple molecules,
3:17
but deciphering whole foreign bodies like Dr.
3:20
Ogi work. How do you know?
3:24
Oh, it took us a very long time to figure this out.
3:27
It really took us many, many decades.
3:29
And the two cores, many, many fantastic new instruments.
3:33
If all of our astrophysical objects or anything they were looking at
3:37
were made up of one element, this would just be so easy.
3:42
But we don't.
3:42
So we have to do experiments on earth like this to prove what we're looking at.
3:48
Looks like what we are thinking. We're looking at.
3:50
So in here is argon.
3:54
If we turn it on here, it glows.
3:57
Is really pretty purple.
3:59
And then if we look at it with a spectroscope,
4:03
it shows us a very specific fingerprint to argon.
4:08
These are called spectral tools, my bounty of tubes.
4:12
They contain the gas of one element.
4:14
And the box runs a voltage through the tube.
4:17
When I turn on the switch, the charged gas turns
4:21
to plasma and emits a color that is unique to that one element.
4:26
It also makes unique lines when you look through the spectroscope.
4:29
And this one is helium.
4:32
This same process happens in a star or a hot region of gas.
4:38
So we use tubes like this
4:39
to verify what we see in space.
4:45
If you do a quick search for spectroscopy data,
4:48
there are numerous ways that the data can appear.
4:51
Those variations are based on the source of the cosmic light.
4:54
There are three types of spectra that we can use.
4:57
Continuous emission and absorption
5:03
light from a hot, dense source
5:05
like the sun produces a continuous spectrum.
5:11
When that light passes through cooler gases on its way to us,
5:15
the gases take away or absorb some of that energy.
5:19
Dark lines appear where specific
5:21
colors are missing,
5:24
and when thin gases glow themselves,
5:28
we see only their characteristic colors.
5:31
Kind of like a cosmic barcode.
5:35
These are the emission spectra from pure elements
5:37
that were given a voltage to glow just like my spectra tube, but way better.
5:43
Like all data.
5:45
There is an art to analyzing spectra.
5:48
Scientists like Dr.
5:49
Oyeleke use computers to calculate and tease out clear signals.
5:53
Comparing them then to models that are already known.
5:58
Many scientists in the labs on earth,
6:00
they tried to recreate the same conditions and measure basically what these
6:06
kind of, as you said, fingerprints of those different transitions
6:09
for different elements are.
6:11
Okay.
6:11
So we're always comparing to sort of the fingerprint of what we have.
6:14
And then if it has deviated from that,
6:17
that is the new information from what we're looking at, correct?
6:21
Farina Spectra unveil the structures of black
6:24
holes, the swirling winds that surround them,
6:28
and those big jets of particles
6:31
that come out of them.
6:34
When you look at a black hole. Yes.
6:37
This is what you see. Yes.
6:39
Where where is the accretion disk?
6:41
Where are the winds?
6:43
So all of this is mostly accretion disk at this level.
6:46
It's just different parts of it. We can zoom in. Right.
6:50
And we see all of the absorption lines.
6:52
Right.
6:52
All of these lines are also shifted a lot.
6:55
So they come from this wind that we saw in the in the first picture.
7:00
So that's how we know that there is winds blowing around
7:03
black holes.
7:11
The same
7:12
principles apply no matter the wavelength of light,
7:15
but each wavelength of light tells us a little something different
7:19
about each character we find in the universe.
7:23
It's pretty wild how different
7:25
the universe looks to our eyes and how it presents to our telescopes.
7:30
And that's precisely why we need to observe in different wavelengths of light.
7:35
Modern astronomy is built upon spectroscopy.
7:39
So with every stream of light we gather, we further
7:43
understand what the universe is made of.
7:46
All we need to do is pry open its contents.
