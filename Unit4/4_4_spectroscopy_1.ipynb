    "# 4.4 Spectroscopy I: Principles of Spectroscopy\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will dive into the fundamental principles of spectroscopy. Spectroscopy is a powerful tool that allows astronomers to analyze the light from stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects. By examining the spectra of light, we can decode the properties of distant objects, such as their chemical composition, temperature, and velocity. We’ll explore the different types of spectra, Kirchhoff’s Laws, and how spectral lines are formed in stellar atmospheres.\n",

    "Light from celestial objects can produce three basic types of spectra, each of which provides unique information about the object being observed:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuous Spectrum\n",
    "A **continuous spectrum** appears as a smooth blend of all colors (or wavelengths), with no gaps. This type of spectrum is typically produced by a hot, dense object, such as a star or a filament in a light bulb, which emits light at all wavelengths. The spectrum emitted by a blackbody is an example of a continuous spectrum.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Emission Spectrum\n",
    "An **emission spectrum** consists of bright lines at specific wavelengths against a dark background. This type of spectrum is produced by a hot, low-density gas, where atoms in the gas emit light at specific wavelengths as electrons move between energy levels.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Absorption Spectrum\n",
    "An **absorption spectrum** is characterized by dark lines superimposed on a continuous spectrum. It is produced when light from a hot, dense object passes through a cooler gas, which absorbs light at specific wavelengths. The dark lines correspond to the wavelengths absorbed by the gas.\n",

    "### Kirchhoff’s First Law:\n",
    "A hot, dense object (such as a blackbody) emits a **continuous spectrum** with light at all wavelengths.\n",

The positions and intensities of these lines help astronomers identify the chemical elements present in the star and determine its physical conditions, such as temperature and pressure.\n",

    "\n",
    "Spectral lines are not infinitely sharp but can become broadened due to several mechanisms. Line broadening provides additional information about the physical conditions in astronomical objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Doppler Broadening\n",
    "The **Doppler effect** causes spectral lines to broaden when the atoms emitting or absorbing light are moving toward or away from the observer. This motion causes the wavelength of the light to shift depending on the velocity of the gas, with faster motions causing broader lines. Doppler broadening can provide insights into the movement of gas in stars or galaxies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pressure Broadening\n",
    "**Pressure broadening** occurs when collisions between particles in a star’s atmosphere cause spectral lines to broaden. The higher the pressure, the more frequent these collisions, and the broader the spectral lines. This type of broadening helps astronomers estimate the pressure and density of the star's atmosphere.\n",

    "In this lesson, we explore the different types of spectra—continuous, emission, and absorption—and how they reveal vital information about celestial objects. Spectroscopy provides a window into the physical conditions, chemical composition, and motions of distant stars, planets, and galaxies. By connecting this to previous lessons on blackbody radiation, atomic structure, and energy transitions, we'll see how light interacts with matter to produce unique patterns of spectral lines.\n",

    "\n",
    "A **continuous spectrum** appears as a smooth distribution of all wavelengths of light without any gaps. This type of spectrum is typically produced by a hot, dense object, such as the core of a star or a heated filament in a light bulb.\n",

    "In **Lesson 4.2** on blackbody radiation, we discussed that any object with a temperature above absolute zero emits thermal radiation. The spectrum of this radiation depends on the object’s temperature. Stars, for example, emit a continuous spectrum because they can be approximated as blackbodies—objects that emit radiation across a broad range of wavelengths, governed by their temperature.\n",

    "### How It's Formed:\n",
    "- **Physics involved**: A continuous spectrum is produced when photons are emitted by charged particles (electrons) that are moving in a dense medium. In stars, this medium is the high-density plasma in the stellar core. As the photons scatter through the dense material, they get redistributed across a range of wavelengths, producing a smooth, continuous spectrum.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Related Concept**: The Stefan-Boltzmann Law (covered in **Lesson 4.2**) tells us that the total energy emitted by a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature ($F = \\sigma T^4$). This law explains why hotter stars are more luminous across all wavelengths, creating a brighter continuous spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "> $$ F = \\sigma T^4 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Lesson 4.2**, we also saw how **Wien's Displacement Law** relates the peak wavelength of the spectrum to the object's temperature, with hotter objects emitting more in the blue (shorter wavelength) part of the spectrum and cooler objects emitting more in the red (longer wavelength) part.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Emission Spectrum\n",
    "\n",
    "An **emission spectrum** consists of bright lines at specific wavelengths against a dark background. This type of spectrum is produced when a hot, low-density gas emits light at particular wavelengths as electrons in the atoms transition between different energy levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It's Formed:\n",
    "- **Physics involved**: As we learned in **Lesson 4.3** on atomic energies, electrons in atoms are confined to discrete energy levels. When an electron in a gas gains enough energy (through collisions or absorption of a photon), it can jump to a higher energy level. When it falls back to a lower energy level, it releases the excess energy as a photon, which corresponds to a specific wavelength of light. These discrete wavelengths appear as bright emission lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Related Concept**: The energy of the emitted photon is given by the difference in energy between the two levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $$ \\Delta E = h \\cdot f $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $h$ is Planck's constant and $f$ is the frequency of the emitted light. The emission lines act like a fingerprint for different elements, as each element has a unique set of energy levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Lesson 4.3**, we saw this principle applied to the **hydrogen atom**, where the Balmer series of emission lines is observed in visible light as electrons transition between higher energy levels and the $n = 2$ level.\n",

    "> Example: The transition from $n = 3$ to $n = 2$ in hydrogen produces the H-alpha line at 656 nm, giving rise to a bright red line in the emission spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples in Astronomy:\n",
    "Emission spectra are observed in nebulae, which are large clouds of gas. For example, in **emission nebulae** like the Orion Nebula, the hot gas emits light at specific wavelengths, revealing the chemical composition of the gas. These bright lines are crucial for identifying elements like hydrogen, helium, and oxygen in space.\n",

    "### Absorption Spectrum\n",
    "\n",
    "An **absorption spectrum** shows dark lines superimposed on a continuous spectrum. This spectrum occurs when light from a hot, dense object (such as the interior of a star) passes through a cooler, less dense gas. The cooler gas absorbs light at specific wavelengths, causing dark lines to appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It's Formed:\n",
    "- **Physics involved**: In **Lesson 4.3**, we learned that electrons in atoms can absorb photons of specific energies, causing them to jump to higher energy levels. The absorbed light corresponds to specific wavelengths, removing these wavelengths from the continuous spectrum of the hot object behind the gas. The result is an absorption line spectrum, where the dark lines indicate which wavelengths have been absorbed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Related Concept**: The absorbed photon must have an energy equal to the difference between two energy levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $$ \\Delta E = h \\cdot f = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the position of the absorption lines in the spectrum reveals the energy levels of the atoms in the gas.\n",

    "### Examples in Astronomy:\n",
    "Absorption spectra are commonly seen when we observe stars. The light from the hot, dense core of the star passes through the outer cooler layers of gas in the star’s atmosphere. The atoms in the outer layers absorb specific wavelengths of light, resulting in an absorption spectrum. These dark absorption lines provide information about the chemical composition of the star's atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
