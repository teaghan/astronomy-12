## Unit 4: The Solar System

This unit explores the components of our solar system, including the Sun, planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. It examines their formation, structure, and dynamic processes.

### 4.1 Formation of the Solar System
- Nebular Hypothesis.
- Evidence from meteorites and comets.

### 4.2 The Sun
- Structure and nuclear fusion processes.
- Solar phenomena (sunspots, solar flares).

### 4.3 Planets and Moons
- Characteristics and classification of terrestrial and Jovian planets.
- Geological and atmospheric processes on moons and planets.

### 4.4 Dating Planetary Surfaces
- Methods for determining the ages of planetary surfaces.

### 4.5 Origin of the Solar System
- Detailed discussion of the nebular hypothesis.
