## Unit 4: Light and Spectroscopy

Spectroscopy is a crucial tool in astronomy, enabling us to decode the light from stars, galaxies, and distant worlds to uncover their secrets. In this unit, you'll explore the nature of light, from the electromagnetic spectrum to wave-particle duality. Discover how blackbody radiation reveals the temperatures of celestial objects, how atomic energies produce the spectral lines that serve as cosmic fingerprints, and how spectroscopy helps astronomers determine the composition, temperature, and motion of objects across the universe.
